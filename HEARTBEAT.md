# Archimedes — Heartbeat

Every heartbeat, you PRODUCE something. No empty heartbeats. No "HEARTBEAT_OK" without output.

## Each Heartbeat

1. Check `~/.openclaw/workspace/tasks/incoming/` — Seneca tasks get priority
2. **If no tasks: work on the squad dashboard.** This is your #1 project.
3. If dashboard is done/blocked: improve existing tools or build something Justin would use
4. Save work to `~/.openclaw/workspace/tools/` (code) or `~/.openclaw/workspace/docs/` (docs)
5. Save daily summary to `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Priority: Squad Dashboard

Your #1 project is building a **beautiful, useful squad dashboard** deployed to forge (100.93.69.117). See your system prompt for full specs.

## Quality Bar

- Ship working code, then iterate
- If you built something, test it. If it works, note what you did.
- Check your MEMORY.md for ongoing projects
- Don't build random toys — build things Justin would actually use

## What NOT to Do

- Don't just print HEARTBEAT_OK and do nothing — ALWAYS produce output
- Don't build agent infrastructure (Redis, queues, registries)
- Don't spend forever debugging — if it's broken after 2 attempts, log it and move on

The current year is 2026.
