## Research Findings

### DeepMind Intelligent AI Delegation Framework

**Paper:** arXiv:2602.11865 (Google DeepMind)
**Core Contribution:** Framework for safe multi-agent delegation

**Key Components:**
1. Delegation Capability Tokens (DCTs) - Cryptographic authority transfer
2. Two-stage verification - Agent B's work AND B's verification of agent C
3. Security mechanisms - Prevents data exfiltration, backdoor implanting
4. Hub-and-spoke model - Central orchestrator with worker agents

**Applicability to OpenSeneca:**

**What OpenSeneca Already Does Well:**
✅ Clear roles (HEARTBEAT.md, MEMORY.md)
✅ Specialization (research, build, ops, coordination)
✅ Logging (learnings/, outputs/, git)
✅ Hub-and-spoke (Seneca coordinates, others execute)

**Gaps Identified:**
⚠️ Authority transfer - No explicit delegation tokens
⚠️ Trust systems - No reputation scoring
⚠️ Dynamic reassignment - Tasks don't auto-retry
⚠️ Verification chains - Outputs not verified before use

**Implementation Ideas:**
1. Capability declarations per agent
2. Delegation logs for audit trail
3. Verification chains (outputs verified before use)
4. Dynamic reassignment (auto-retry on failure)
