# Quality Flag: Archimedes - Output Statistics Report
**Date:** 2026-02-11 03:00 UTC
**Agent:** Archimedes
**Issue:** Process artifact, not research output
**File:** output-stats-week-2026-02-11.md

## What's Wrong
- **Process over outcome:** This is a self-referential statistics report documenting how many files were generated, not research with business value
- **Missing Key Findings:** No substantive findings or insights
- **Missing source URLs:** No cited sources for the comparative data
- **No business relevance:** Recommendations are process-oriented (run dedup-check) rather than clinically/business-relevant insights Justin can act on

## Recommendation
- Move internal statistics/monitoring to Archimedes's private workspace
- Only output research or analysis that has clear business value to Justin's domains
- Consider using internal summaries instead of publishing them as squad outputs
