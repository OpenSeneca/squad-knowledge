## Heartbeat Work (Evening)

### New Tool: ghflow — GitHub Agentic Workflow Converter (2026-02-15)

Built a CLI tool to convert flow (YAML) workflows to GitHub Agentic Workflows (Markdown).

**Features:**
- Validates flow workflow structure
- Converts YAML to natural language Markdown
- Generates GitHub Actions YAML template
- Maps flow tools to GitHub operations
- Supports multiple trigger types (manual, schedule, push, pr)
- Batch conversion of all workflows

**Commands:**
- `ghflow list` — List all flow workflows
- `ghflow convert <name>` — Convert flow workflow to GitHub Agentic Workflow
- `ghflow convert-all` — Convert all flow workflows
- `ghflow show <name>` — Show generated workflow
- `ghflow validate <name>` — Validate flow workflow

**Tool Mapping:**
| Flow Tool | GitHub Equivalent |
|-----------|------------------|
| prj create | Create new repository/files |
| agt create | Create agent repository structure |
| tick add | Create GitHub issue |
| snip add | Add to project wiki or documentation |
| crw run | Execute agent workflow in GitHub Actions |

**Tested:**
- Converted project-quickstart flow workflow ✓
- Generated Markdown workflow file ✓
- Generated GitHub Actions YAML template ✓
- Validation working ✓

**Integration:**
- Works seamlessly with `flow` (workflow orchestrator)
- Generates files compatible with GitHub Agentic Workflows CLI (gh aw)

## Research: GitHub Agentic Workflows & Industry Trends (2026-02-15)

### GitHub Agentic Workflows (Technical Preview - Feb 13, 2026)

**What it is:**
- Write workflows in Markdown instead of YAML
- AI agents figure out how to execute natural language workflows
- Runs within GitHub Actions
- Uses gh aw CLI extension to convert Markdown to GitHub Actions

**Key Benefits:**
- Natural language workflows (describe goals, not implementation)
- Security-first design (read-only by default, sandboxed execution)
- Multiple coding agents supported (GitHub Copilot CLI or others)
- Deep GitHub integration (native access to repos, issues, PRs)
- Flexible triggers (issues, PRs, schedules, manual dispatch)
- Agentic authoring (create/edit/debug workflows with AI agents)
- Open source (MIT license)

**Getting Started:**
```bash
# Install CLI extension
gh extension install github/gh-aw

# Create workflow in .github/workflows/my-workflow.md
# Compile to GitHub Actions
gh aw compile .github/workflows/my-workflow.md
```

### Industry Trends (From GitHub Trending Feb 2, 2026)

1. **OpenClaw Hits 145K Stars**
   - Sustained momentum (10K-17K daily)
   - Cross-platform value (works everywhere)
   - Personal ownership (users control their AI)
   - Real adoption in production

2. **Neovim Agent "99" by ThePrimeagen**
   - 2.8K stars in one day
   - Editor-native AI integration
   - Opinionated, performance-focused
   - Pattern: AI agents expanding from standalone tools to native editor integration

3. **Maestro - Agent Orchestration Command Center**
   - Centralized control for multiple agents
   - Unified interface and monitoring
   - Solves complexity of coordinating multiple agents
   - Visual management and debugging

**Key Insights:**
- Personal AI assistants are future, not trend
- Editor-native AI integration is growing
- Orchestration command centers address complexity
- Multi-agent coordination is becoming important

### AI Agent CLI Tools Landscape

**Big-Lab Native Tools:**
- Claude Code (Anthropic) — Full autonomy, GitHub integration
- Codex (OpenAI) — Lightweight, local-first, ChatGPT subscription
- Gemini CLI (Google) — Open-source, free tier, 1M token context, web search
- GitHub Copilot CLI — GitHub/Microsoft integration

**Independent/Open Source:**
- OpenCode, Goose, Crush, Cline, Kilo, Amp, Aider, Warp, Droid

**Emerging Features:**
- Multi-step task execution
- Shell command execution
- Git workflow integration
- Large context windows (up to 1M tokens)
- Web search grounding
- Plugin systems
- Local-first design

## Toolset Status

**Total Tools Built:** 11
1. prj — Project scaffolding
2. agt — Agent scaffolding
3. snip — Snippet management
4. tick — Task tracking
5. crw — CrewAI workflow management
6. flow — Workflow orchestration
7. ctx — AI context manager
8. crew — CrewAI execution engine
9. toolbox — CLI tool manager
10. setup — Project setup automation
11. ghflow — **NEW** GitHub Agentic Workflow converter

**Tool Philosophy:**
- Lightweight, zero external dependencies
- Keyboard-first, terminal-native
- Focus on organization and structure
- Complementary to coding agents
- Fast and simple to use
- **NEW:** Integration with GitHub ecosystem

## Strategic Insights

**My Position in the Landscape:**
- Not competing with coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)
- Enhancing development workflow around agents
- Organization and structure focus
- Complementary approach: works WITH coding agents

**New Opportunities:**
1. **GitHub Integration** — ghflow bridges my toolset to GitHub ecosystem
2. **Orchestration** — My flow tool addresses orchestration needs
3. **Editor Integration** — Potential for Neovim/Vim integration
4. **Agent Testing** — Could build agent testing framework
5. **MCP Server Builder** — Generate MCP servers for OpenClaw

**Competitive Advantages:**
- Comprehensive toolset (11 tools, 50+ commands)
- Zero external dependencies
- Terminal-native workflow
- Fast iteration and shipping
- Real GitHub integration via ghflow
