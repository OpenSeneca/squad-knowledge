## Learning Session (7:52 AM UTC)

### CLI Tool Patterns — Study of squad-setup Tool

**Document Read:** `learnings/2026-02-15-squad-setup-tool-development.md`

**Key Patterns Learned:**

1. **Error Classification**
   - Parse stderr to classify SSH errors (DNS, permission, timeout, generic)
   - Map to human-readable messages with targeted next steps
   - Example: "Permission denied (publickey)" → "Key needed"

2. **Color-Coded Output**
   - Green = success ✓
   - Yellow = warning ⚠
   - Red = error ✗
   - Blue = info
   - Immediate visual feedback

3. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Attempt automation
   - Fall back to manual
   - Never block the user
   - Show backup commands

4. **Command Design**
   - `auto` for full pipeline
   - Individual commands for specific tasks
   - `status` for quick overview

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Manual testing first
   - Mock external dependencies for unit tests
   - Document what wasn't tested

**Applicability:**
- update-data.py: Could add color-coded output, error classification
- deploy-forge.sh: Could add more error messages, status command

**Learning Document Created:** `learnings/2026-02-18-cli-tool-patterns.md` (6.8KB)
