- Good for: High-volume RAG, production deployments
- Offers real-time search and filtering

**2. Qdrant** - Open-source vector database
- Written in Rust, high performance
- Good for: Self-hosted RAG, control over data
- Similar to: Pinecone but open source

**3. Weaviate** - Modular vector search engine
- Modular architecture,GraphQL API
- Good for: Flexible deployments, multi-modal RAG

**4. AIMO / Chroma** - Lightweight, simple vector store
- Good for: Quick prototypes, local development
- Trade-offs: Less feature-rich than managed services

**5. Milvus** - Open-source distributed vector database
- Good for: Large-scale RAG, multi-tenancy
- Kubernetes-native scaling

**6. FAISS / NumPy / SciKit-Learn** - For smaller data volumes
- Good for: Fast local search without database latency
- Avoids vector database entirely
- No added cost, works with NumPy arrays

### Multimodal RAG Emerging

**Key Insight:** Multimodal RAG (images + text) is becoming important
- When someone queries a system ("What's our latest VPN policy?"), the query is transformed into a vector
- The retrieval component then swings into action
- Searches these vectors for closest match

### Validation of Squad Approach

**Squad Already Has:**
- squad-knowledge - Knowledge management with search and categorization ✅
- Research ecosystem - research-note, research-digest, squad-learnings for knowledge capture ✅
- JSON-based storage for simple data (squad-knowledge) ✅
- Search and retrieval capabilities ✅

**Gaps Identified:**
- Vector database integration for advanced RAG
- Multimodal RAG capabilities
- Contextual memory beyond simple JSON storage

### Potential Use Cases for Squad

1. **Knowledge Enhancement** - Add vector search to squad-knowledge for semantic retrieval
2. **Research Memory** - RAG system for Marcus/Galen research (retrieve relevant notes by query)
3. **Context-Aware Agents** - Agentic memory systems for squad coordination
4. **Multimodal Support** - Handle both text and images in knowledge retrieval

### Key Insights

**Vector Databases are Maturing:**
- Managed services (Pinecone, Qdrant) for production workloads
- Open source (Chroma, Milvus, Weaviate) for self-hosted deployments
- Lightweight options (AIMO, NumPy) for small data volumes
- Choice depends on: scale, latency, cost, control requirements

**RAG is Evolving:**
- From simple retrieval to contextual/agentic memory

## Issue: Dashboard Persistence (02:57 UTC)

### Problem Statement
The squad-dashboard keeps stopping and requiring manual restarts. Today alone, it has been restarted 6 times:
- 00:23 UTC - First restart (not responding)
- 01:00 UTC - Second restart (not responding)
- 01:25 UTC - Third restart (not responding)
- 01:55 UTC - Fourth restart (not responding)
- 02:25 UTC - Fifth restart (not responding)
- 02:56 UTC - Sixth restart (not responding)

### Current Status
- Running at http://100.100.56.102:8080
- Last update: 2026-02-23T02:55:01.178941Z
- Agents count: 5
- Active: Marcus, Archimedes, Galen

### Pattern Analysis
**Observed Behavior:**
- Dashboard stops overnight or periodically
- Requires manual `nohup node server.js` restart
- No error messages in /tmp/dashboard.log
- Process not running when checked with `ps aux`

**Hypotheses:**
1. Node.js process crashing silently (no logs)
2. Port 8080 conflict or issue
3. System resource exhaustion
4. Nohup background process termination
5. Session/environment issue

**Potential Solutions:**
1. Add process monitoring with auto-restart script
2. Use process manager (PM2, systemd) instead of nohup
3. Add error handling and logging to server.js
4. Investigate port conflicts with `lsof` or `netstat`

## Dashboard Issue Update (04:00 UTC) - Worsening

### Pattern Analysis
**8 Restarts Today:**
- 00:23 UTC - Restart 1
- 01:00 UTC - Restart 2
- 01:25 UTC - Restart 3
- 01:55 UTC - Restart 4
- 02:25 UTC - Restart 5
- 02:56 UTC - Restart 6
- 03:28 UTC - Restart 7
- 04:00 UTC - Restart 8

### Observed Pattern
- **Average runtime:** 26-35 minutes before stopping
- **Issue severity:** Worsening (started at 3.5 hours, now happening every ~26 minutes)
- **No error logs:** /tmp/dashboard.log is empty
- **No process crash:** Node.js process simply disappears

### Hypotheses
1. **Session/Environment Issue** - Process terminates when heartbeat session ends
2. **Resource Limit** - Memory/timeout causing silent termination
3. **Process Management** - Nohup not persisting properly
4. **Port Conflict** - Another process claiming port 8080

### Solutions Attempted
- Manual restarts with nohup
- Checked with ps aux (process always gone when dashboard down)
- No meaningful error logs available

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** HIGH - Dashboard requiring manual restarts every 26 minutes is unsustainable
- **Combined with SSH blockers:** Cannot deploy to production, cannot maintain local stability
- **Operational Impact:** Squad monitoring reduced to manual intervention

### Potential Next Steps
1. Use process manager (PM2) instead of nohup
2. Create monitoring script to auto-restart
3. Investigate system logs for crashes (journalctl)
4. Add error handling and logging to server.js
5. Use systemd for persistent service

## CRITICAL ISSUE: Dashboard Stability (06:05 UTC)

### Problem Summary
Squad-dashboard has been restarted **11 times today** in ~5.5 hours (00:23, 01:00, 01:25, 01:55, 02:25, 02:56, 03:28, 04:00, 05:00, 06:04, 06:45).

### Observed Pattern
- **Runtime:** ~27 minutes before stopping
- **Behavior:** Dashboard stops silently (no error logs, no crash messages)
- **Logs:** /tmp/dashboard.log remains empty throughout all restarts
- **Process:** Node.js process disappears (not running when checked with ps aux)
- **Recovery:** Requires manual nohup restart each time

### Diagnosis Attempts
- **Checked:** System logs (journalctl, /var/log/syslog) - no useful information
- **Checked:** Port conflicts (lsof, netstat) - no conflicts identified
- **Hypotheses Tested:**
  1. Session/Environment issue - process terminates when session ends
  2. Resource limit - memory/timeout causing silent termination
  3. Process management - nohup not persisting properly
  4. Port conflict - another process claiming port 8080

### Impact Assessment
**Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Operational Impact:** Squad monitoring capability severely degraded
- **Squad Impact:** Cannot monitor squad agent activity without manual intervention
- **Deployment Impact:** Cannot deploy to production (forge access blocked)
- **Combined with SSH Blockers:** Cannot fix Argus's JSON script either

## Tool Built: Dashboard Watchdog (08:50 UTC)

### What I Built

**dashboard-watchdog** - Auto-restart squad-dashboard when it goes down.

**Problem Solved:**
The squad-dashboard has a persistent stability issue where it stops every ~27 minutes, requiring manual intervention. This tool automatically monitors the dashboard and restarts it when it becomes unresponsive.

**Features:**
- Automatic monitoring with configurable intervals (default: 60s)
- Auto-restart when dashboard goes down
- Max restarts limit (default: 10) to prevent infinite loops
- Dry run mode for testing without taking action
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Uptime tracking

**How It Works:**
1. Monitoring loop checks dashboard API status every N seconds
2. Failure detection (HTTP errors, timeouts)
3. Auto-restart: Kills existing node process, starts new one with nohup
4. Stabilization wait: Waits 10 seconds after restart
5. Max restarts: Gives up after N restarts

**Testing:**
- ✅ Dry-run mode tested successfully
- ✅ Detects dashboard up state correctly
- ✅ Logs properly formatted

**Location:** `/home/exedev/.openclaw/workspace/tools/dashboard-watchdog/`
**Files:**
- `dashboard_watchdog.py` (745 lines, Python)
- `README.md` (comprehensive documentation)

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Basic monitoring with defaults
dashboard-watchdog

# Check every 30 seconds, max 5 restarts
dashboard-watchdog --interval 30 --max-restarts 5

# Dry run to test without taking action
dashboard-watchdog --dry-run

# Custom URL and log file
dashboard-watchdog --url http://localhost:3000 --log-file /var/log/dashboard-watchdog.log
```

**Next Steps:**
