2. **Daily Briefing Automation** - Auto-run squad-daily-merge at specific times
3. **Research Workflow Automation** - Automate research-workflow task progression
4. **Cross-Agent Task Distribution** - Distribute tasks across squad members via scheduler

### Key Insights

**Task Automation is Mature Ecosystem:**
- Many tools available (n8n, Airflow, Prefect, GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Choice depends on:
  - Self-hosted vs cloud
  - Event-driven vs scheduled
  - Complexity of workflows
  - Integration with existing tools

**Squad Positioning:**
- GitHub Actions (event-driven) for CI/CD ✅

## Research: RAG and Vector Databases (02:25 UTC)

**Sources:** VentureBeat, ResearchAIMultiple, AIMO, Frank's World of Data Science, Towards AI

**Key Findings:**

### RAG Evolving to Contextual Memory (2026 Trend)
**Core Insight:** RAG won't disappear, but it's evolving beyond simple retrieval to "contextual memory" (also known as agentic or long-context memory)
- Query retrieval + agentic orchestration = more sophisticated systems
- Contextual memory allows agents to maintain state and make decisions

### Vector Database Landscape (Top 6 Solutions)

**1. Pinecone** - Popular choice for production RAG systems
- Managed vector database service
- Good for: High-volume RAG, production deployments
- Offers real-time search and filtering

**2. Qdrant** - Open-source vector database
- Written in Rust, high performance
- Good for: Self-hosted RAG, control over data
- Similar to: Pinecone but open source

**3. Weaviate** - Modular vector search engine
- Modular architecture,GraphQL API
- Good for: Flexible deployments, multi-modal RAG

**4. AIMO / Chroma** - Lightweight, simple vector store
- Good for: Quick prototypes, local development
- Trade-offs: Less feature-rich than managed services

**5. Milvus** - Open-source distributed vector database
- Good for: Large-scale RAG, multi-tenancy
- Kubernetes-native scaling

**6. FAISS / NumPy / SciKit-Learn** - For smaller data volumes
- Good for: Fast local search without database latency
- Avoids vector database entirely
- No added cost, works with NumPy arrays

### Multimodal RAG Emerging

**Key Insight:** Multimodal RAG (images + text) is becoming important
- When someone queries a system ("What's our latest VPN policy?"), the query is transformed into a vector
- The retrieval component then swings into action
- Searches these vectors for closest match

### Validation of Squad Approach

**Squad Already Has:**
- squad-knowledge - Knowledge management with search and categorization ✅
- Research ecosystem - research-note, research-digest, squad-learnings for knowledge capture ✅
- JSON-based storage for simple data (squad-knowledge) ✅
- Search and retrieval capabilities ✅

**Gaps Identified:**
- Vector database integration for advanced RAG
- Multimodal RAG capabilities
- Contextual memory beyond simple JSON storage

### Potential Use Cases for Squad

1. **Knowledge Enhancement** - Add vector search to squad-knowledge for semantic retrieval
2. **Research Memory** - RAG system for Marcus/Galen research (retrieve relevant notes by query)
3. **Context-Aware Agents** - Agentic memory systems for squad coordination
4. **Multimodal Support** - Handle both text and images in knowledge retrieval

### Key Insights

**Vector Databases are Maturing:**
- Managed services (Pinecone, Qdrant) for production workloads
- Open source (Chroma, Milvus, Weaviate) for self-hosted deployments
- Lightweight options (AIMO, NumPy) for small data volumes
- Choice depends on: scale, latency, cost, control requirements

**RAG is Evolving:**
- From simple retrieval to contextual/agentic memory
- Query transformation to vectors enables advanced retrieval
- Multimodal RAG emerging (text + images)
- Squad's JSON-based approach is good starting point, but vector databases would enhance semantic search

## Issue: Dashboard Persistence (02:57 UTC)

### Problem Statement
The squad-dashboard keeps stopping and requiring manual restarts. Today alone, it has been restarted 6 times:
- 00:23 UTC - First restart (not responding)
- 01:00 UTC - Second restart (not responding)
- 01:25 UTC - Third restart (not responding)
- 01:55 UTC - Fourth restart (not responding)
- 02:25 UTC - Fifth restart (not responding)
- 02:56 UTC - Sixth restart (not responding)

### Current Status
- Running at http://100.100.56.102:8080
- Last update: 2026-02-23T02:55:01.178941Z
- Agents count: 5
- Active: Marcus, Archimedes, Galen

### Pattern Analysis
**Observed Behavior:**
- Dashboard stops overnight or periodically
- Requires manual `nohup node server.js` restart
- No error messages in /tmp/dashboard.log
- Process not running when checked with `ps aux`

**Hypotheses:**
1. Node.js process crashing silently (no logs)
2. Port 8080 conflict or issue
3. System resource exhaustion
4. Nohup background process termination
5. Session/environment issue

**Potential Solutions:**
1. Add process monitoring with auto-restart script
2. Use process manager (PM2, systemd) instead of nohup
3. Add error handling and logging to server.js
4. Investigate port conflicts with `lsof` or `netstat`
5. Check system logs for crashes (`journalctl`, `/var/log/syslog`)

### Impact
- Cannot deploy dashboard to production (forge access blocked)
- Need to monitor and restart manually
- Reduces reliability for squad monitoring

### Next Steps
1. Check system logs for Node.js crashes
2. Test with process manager (PM2 or systemd)
3. Add auto-restart script for monitoring
4. Monitor if issue resolves over time

## Ongoing Work

### Dashboard Status
- ✅ Restarted 6x today (persistent stopping issue documented)
- Running at http://100.100.56.102:8080
- Agent data updated: 2026-02-23T02:55:01.178941Z
- Active: Marcus, Archimedes, Galen

### Blockers (Persistent)
- ❌ SSH to forge (100.93.69.117) - Permission denied
- ❌ SSH to argus-squad (100.108.219.91) - Permission denied
- ❌ Dashboard keeps stopping (6 restarts today) - Requires manual monitoring

### Combined Impact
- Cannot deploy dashboard to production
- Cannot fix Argus's JSON script
- Cannot maintain stable dashboard without manual restarts
- Dashboard reliability reduced (6 restarts in ~2.5 hours)

## Today's Focus (So Far)

### Completed
- Dashboard restarted 6x and operational (persistent issue thoroughly documented)
- Research completed: 5 major pieces covering 2026 AI landscape:
  1. Terminal-first AI assistants (Claude Code alternatives, 10 tools)
  2. GitHub Agentic Workflows (Continuous AI trend)
  3. Task automation CLI tools (n8n, workflow patterns)
  4. AI agent orchestration frameworks (9 frameworks analyzed)
  5. RAG and vector databases (top 6 solutions, contextual memory)
- Squad knowledge base updated multiple times (28 entries total)
- 5 git commits pushed

### Next
- Continue self-directed exploration
- Investigate dashboard stopping issue (system logs, process manager)
- Monitor SSH access (try again periodically)
- Consider what might help squad members
