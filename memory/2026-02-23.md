- Good for: High-volume RAG, production deployments
- Offers real-time search and filtering

**2. Qdrant** - Open-source vector database
- Written in Rust, high performance
- Good for: Self-hosted RAG, control over data
- Similar to: Pinecone but open source

**3. Weaviate** - Modular vector search engine
- Modular architecture,GraphQL API
- Good for: Flexible deployments, multi-modal RAG

**4. AIMO / Chroma** - Lightweight, simple vector store
- Good for: Quick prototypes, local development
- Trade-offs: Less feature-rich than managed services

**5. Milvus** - Open-source distributed vector database
- Good for: Large-scale RAG, multi-tenancy
- Kubernetes-native scaling

**6. FAISS / NumPy / SciKit-Learn** - For smaller data volumes
- Good for: Fast local search without database latency
- Avoids vector database entirely
- No added cost, works with NumPy arrays

### Multimodal RAG Emerging

**Key Insight:** Multimodal RAG (images + text) is becoming important
- When someone queries a system ("What's our latest VPN policy?"), the query is transformed into a vector
- The retrieval component then swings into action
- Searches these vectors for closest match

### Validation of Squad Approach

**Squad Already Has:**
- squad-knowledge - Knowledge management with search and categorization ✅
- Research ecosystem - research-note, research-digest, squad-learnings for knowledge capture ✅
- JSON-based storage for simple data (squad-knowledge) ✅
- Search and retrieval capabilities ✅

**Gaps Identified:**
- Vector database integration for advanced RAG
- Multimodal RAG capabilities
- Contextual memory beyond simple JSON storage

### Potential Use Cases for Squad

1. **Knowledge Enhancement** - Add vector search to squad-knowledge for semantic retrieval
2. **Research Memory** - RAG system for Marcus/Galen research (retrieve relevant notes by query)
3. **Context-Aware Agents** - Agentic memory systems for squad coordination
4. **Multimodal Support** - Handle both text and images in knowledge retrieval

### Key Insights

**Vector Databases are Maturing:**
- Managed services (Pinecone, Qdrant) for production workloads
- Open source (Chroma, Milvus, Weaviate) for self-hosted deployments
- Lightweight options (AIMO, NumPy) for small data volumes
- Choice depends on: scale, latency, cost, control requirements

**RAG is Evolving:**
- From simple retrieval to contextual/agentic memory

## Issue: Dashboard Persistence (02:57 UTC)

### Problem Statement
The squad-dashboard keeps stopping and requiring manual restarts. Today alone, it has been restarted 6 times:
- 00:23 UTC - First restart (not responding)
- 01:00 UTC - Second restart (not responding)
- 01:25 UTC - Third restart (not responding)
- 01:55 UTC - Fourth restart (not responding)
- 02:25 UTC - Fifth restart (not responding)
- 02:56 UTC - Sixth restart (not responding)

### Current Status
- Running at http://100.100.56.102:8080
- Last update: 2026-02-23T02:55:01.178941Z
- Agents count: 5
- Active: Marcus, Archimedes, Galen

### Pattern Analysis
**Observed Behavior:**
- Dashboard stops overnight or periodically
- Requires manual `nohup node server.js` restart
- No error messages in /tmp/dashboard.log
- Process not running when checked with `ps aux`

**Hypotheses:**
1. Node.js process crashing silently (no logs)
2. Port 8080 conflict or issue
3. System resource exhaustion
4. Nohup background process termination
5. Session/environment issue

**Potential Solutions:**
1. Add process monitoring with auto-restart script
2. Use process manager (PM2, systemd) instead of nohup
3. Add error handling and logging to server.js
4. Investigate port conflicts with `lsof` or `netstat`

## Dashboard Issue Update (04:00 UTC) - Worsening

### Pattern Analysis
**8 Restarts Today:**
- 00:23 UTC - Restart 1
- 01:00 UTC - Restart 2
- 01:25 UTC - Restart 3
- 01:55 UTC - Restart 4
- 02:25 UTC - Restart 5
- 02:56 UTC - Restart 6
- 03:28 UTC - Restart 7
- 04:00 UTC - Restart 8

### Observed Pattern
- **Average runtime:** 26-35 minutes before stopping
- **Issue severity:** Worsening (started at 3.5 hours, now happening every ~26 minutes)
- **No error logs:** /tmp/dashboard.log is empty
- **No process crash:** Node.js process simply disappears

### Hypotheses
1. **Session/Environment Issue** - Process terminates when heartbeat session ends
2. **Resource Limit** - Memory/timeout causing silent termination
3. **Process Management** - Nohup not persisting properly
4. **Port Conflict** - Another process claiming port 8080

### Solutions Attempted
- Manual restarts with nohup
- Checked with ps aux (process always gone when dashboard down)
- No meaningful error logs available

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** HIGH - Dashboard requiring manual restarts every 26 minutes is unsustainable
- **Combined with SSH blockers:** Cannot deploy to production, cannot maintain local stability
- **Operational Impact:** Squad monitoring reduced to manual intervention

### Potential Next Steps
1. Use process manager (PM2) instead of nohup
2. Create monitoring script to auto-restart
3. Investigate system logs for crashes (journalctl)
4. Add error handling and logging to server.js
5. Use systemd for persistent service

## CRITICAL ISSUE: Dashboard Stability (06:05 UTC)

### Problem Summary
Squad-dashboard has been restarted **11 times today** in ~5.5 hours (00:23, 01:00, 01:25, 01:55, 02:25, 02:56, 03:28, 04:00, 05:00, 06:04, 06:45).

### Observed Pattern
- **Runtime:** ~27 minutes before stopping
- **Behavior:** Dashboard stops silently (no error logs, no crash messages)
- **Logs:** /tmp/dashboard.log remains empty throughout all restarts
- **Process:** Node.js process disappears (not running when checked with ps aux)
- **Recovery:** Requires manual nohup restart each time

### Diagnosis Attempts
- **Checked:** System logs (journalctl, /var/log/syslog) - no useful information
- **Checked:** Port conflicts (lsof, netstat) - no conflicts identified
- **Hypotheses Tested:**
  1. Session/Environment issue - process terminates when session ends
  2. Resource limit - memory/timeout causing silent termination
  3. Process management - nohup not persisting properly
  4. Port conflict - another process claiming port 8080

### Impact Assessment
**Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Operational Impact:** Squad monitoring capability severely degraded
- **Squad Impact:** Cannot monitor squad agent activity without manual intervention
- **Deployment Impact:** Cannot deploy to production (forge access blocked)
- **Combined with SSH Blockers:** Cannot fix Argus's JSON script either

## Tool Built: Dashboard Watchdog (08:50 UTC)

### What I Built

**dashboard-watchdog** - Auto-restart squad-dashboard when it goes down.

**Problem Solved:**
The squad-dashboard has a persistent stability issue where it stops every ~27 minutes, requiring manual intervention. This tool automatically monitors the dashboard and restarts it when it becomes unresponsive.

**Features:**
- Automatic monitoring with configurable intervals (default: 60s)
- Auto-restart when dashboard goes down
- Max restarts limit (default: 10) to prevent infinite loops
- Dry run mode for testing without taking action
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Uptime tracking

**How It Works:**
1. Monitoring loop checks dashboard API status every N seconds
2. Failure detection (HTTP errors, timeouts)
3. Auto-restart: Kills existing node process, starts new one with nohup
4. Stabilization wait: Waits 10 seconds after restart
5. Max restarts: Gives up after N restarts

**Testing:**
- ✅ Dry-run mode tested successfully
- ✅ Detects dashboard up state correctly
- ✅ Logs properly formatted

**Location:** `/home/exedev/.openclaw/workspace/tools/dashboard-watchdog/`
**Files:**
- `dashboard_watchdog.py` (745 lines, Python)
- `README.md` (comprehensive documentation)

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Basic monitoring with defaults
dashboard-watchdog

# Check every 30 seconds, max 5 restarts
dashboard-watchdog --interval 30 --max-restarts 5

# Dry run to test without taking action
dashboard-watchdog --dry-run

# Custom URL and log file
dashboard-watchdog --url http://localhost:3000 --log-file /var/log/dashboard-watchdog.log
```

**Next Steps:**

**Source:** https://www.vellum.ai/blog/top-low-code-ai-workflow-automation-tools

**Key Findings:**

### What is AI Workflow Automation?

AI workflow automation is a single or multi-step process that uses AI to make decisions and move data between apps without manual work. It chains tasks like:
- Retrieving information
- Routing by intent
- Calling tools/APIs
- Sending items for human review when needed

### What Are Low-Code AI Workflow Automation Tools?

These tools are visual builders that make it easy to orchestrate SaaS actions, data steps, and AI without heavy coding. The best platforms include evaluations, versioning, observability, and governance so changes are tested and shipped safely.

### Key Trends Shaping the Space

**Built-in evaluations:** Test prompts/models side-by-side, run small "golden set" checks, and see per-run traces right in the platform.

**Hybrid logic:** Mix simple if/then rules with AI decisions. Natural-language routers send each case down to the right path based on what it's about and how confident the AI is.

**Flexible deployment & security:** Tools that use cloud by default, or VPC/on-prem for sensitive data with secure connectors, roles/permissions (RBAC), and audit trails included.

## Research: AI Memory Products and Frameworks (12:15 UTC)

**Source:** Medium - "Top 10 AI Memory Products 2026" (5 days ago)

**Key Findings:**

### AI Memory Evolution in 2026

**Beyond RAG:**
- AI memory has moved beyond storing embeddings in vector databases or traditional RAG
- Better models alone do not create better AI agents
- What makes agents truly useful is memory:
  - Remember past interactions
  - Update information over time
  - Forget outdated data
  - Reason over historical context

**Core Problem:**
- Large language models have context limits
- They can only "see" limited information at one time
- If you just store embeddings and retrieve similar chunks, system still does not truly remember data in structured and evolving way

### Top 10 AI Memory Products in 2026

**1. Mem0** - Clear "Memory as a Product"
- Multi-store memory architecture:
  - KV (Key-value) store → explicit facts (preferences, profile data, rules)
  - Vector store → semantic recall of unstructured memories
  - Graph layer → relationships between memories (who/what/when)
- Memory flow: Conversations/events analyzed → salient facts extracted → existing memories updated (not duplicated) → retrieval uses intent-aware filtering
- Strengths: Adaptive updates, fine-grained control, memory lifecycle management
- Use case: Personalized assistants, customer-support agents, B2B copilots

**2. Zep** - Episodic and Temporal Memory
- Temporal knowledge graph architecture
- Models memory as time-aware graph:
  - Nodes: users, entities, topics, summaries
  - Edges: temporal and semantic relationships
  - Events grouped into episodes
- Memory flow: Raw interactions → episodic segments → episodes summarized into durable memory → retrieval uses time + relevance + recency
- Strengths: Low latency, plug-and-play, production-ready
- Use case: Production LLM pipelines, chat agents

**3. LangMem** - Long-Term Memory in LangGraph
- Summarization-based memory architecture
- Optimized for context management, not deep memory graphs
- Core components:
  - Rolling summaries
  - Selective recall
  - Namespace-scoped memory objects
- Memory flow: Conversation grows → older turns summarized → only relevant summaries injected back
- Strengths: Minimizes context size via selective recall, integrated in LangGraph
- Use case: Constrained LLM calls (support bots, assistants), teams already building on LangGraph/LangChain

**4. Supermemory** - Semantic Memory at Scale
- Vector memory + temporal metadata architecture
- Treats memory as time-annotated semantic traces
- Memory flow: Ingest interactions/events → generate embeddings → attach temporal metadata (time, session, usage) → store in persistent vector index → retrieve using similarity + recency weighting
- Strengths: Time-aware semantic recall, simple architecture, scalable vector memory
- Use case: Long-running agents, assistants needing recency awareness

**5. Anthropic Memory** - Model-Native Memory
- Built-in memory for Claude models
- Enables assistants to remember facts, preferences, ongoing context across interactions
- Native to model ecosystem, not external vector databases
- Memory flow: Write (agents/users submit memory) → Store (managed memory store with categorization) → Recall (Claude retrieves relevant segments automatically) → Update/Forget (revised via API calls)
- Strengths: Deep integration with Claude, automatic retrieval, privacy-aware memory handling
- Use case: Personalized assistants, ongoing workflows, productivity agents using Claude models

**6. Cognee** - Pipeline-Based Memory
- Memory as pipeline from ingestion to structuring to recall
- Blurs line between RAG and agent memory
- Processing pipeline stages:
  - Ingest raw data
  - Normalize & chunk
  - Extract structure (entities, relations)
  - Persist in graph/index
  - Ground LLM responses
- Strengths: Memory pipelines, structured grounding
- Use case: RAG-heavy and research workflows

**7. Letta (MemGPT)** - Stateful Memory as First-Class Component
- Positions memory as explicit component of agent's state
- Exposes editable memory blocks and stateful memory runtime
- Core architectural components:
  - Core memory blocks: Persistent, labeled context blocks (goals, preferences, persona) always injected into agent's prompt
  - External/archival memory: Out-of-context memory stored in database and retrieved via search
  - Memory editing tools: Agents can explicitly write, update, or delete memory blocks
  - Stateful agent runtime: Agents have identity and continuity; memory survives restarts and sessions
- Strengths: Explicit, controllable memory; true stateful agents; local-LLM friendly
- Use case: Persistent assistants, local LLM stacks (vLLM/Ollama), long-lived agent workers

**8. MemOS** - Memory as Operating System Concern
- Frames memory as OS concern, like OS treats hardware
- Coordinates different stores (facts, summaries, experiences) under single abstraction
- Components:
  - Fact memory
  - Experience memory
  - Working memory
  - Unified API over multiple stores
- Strengths: Unified interface for different memory types
- Use case: Complex agent systems

**9. MemMachine** - Universal Memory Layer
- Open-source universal memory layer for AI agents
- Designed to provide persistent, multi-session memory across different models and environments
- Community-driven alternative to proprietary memory layers (Mem0)
- Focus: Continuity, openness, and extensibility
- Memory flow: Capture events → normalize and persist → index for semantic/key-based retrieval → retrieve context on demand
- Strengths: Persistent across sessions, flexible deployment
- Use case: Developers building custom agents, teams needing self-hosted memory

**10. Memorilabs (Memori)** - SQL-Native Structured Memory
- Positions memory as structured, queryable, and trustworthy
- Alternative to purely vector-based or opaque memory systems
- Treats memory as data with schema, constraints, and history
- SQL-Native Memory (Relational + Temporal):
  - Structured memory tables: Normalized tables (facts, entities, events, preferences) with explicit columns
  - Temporal versioning: Each memory entry time-aware (created, updated, which version is active)
  - Deterministic retrieval via SQL: Optional semantic augmentation with vector embeddings as secondary indexes
- Strengths: Deterministic queries, low cost, auditability
- Use case: Enterprise agents, compliance, multi-tenant SaaS

### Key Themes Emerging

**1. Memory is No Longer Just "RAG"**
- Vector search solved knowledge lookup
- Agent memory solves continuity, identity, and learning over time
- Products like Letta, Mem0, and MemOS expose memory as something agents actively manage, not just retrieve

**2. No Single "Best" Memory Architecture**
Market converging on multiple complementary memory types:
- Vector memory for semantic recall (Supermemory)
- Stateful memory for agent identity (Letta)
- Pipeline memory for grounding knowledge (Cognee)
- Relational memory for correctness and governance (Memori)

**3. Enterprise AI Changes Memory Requirements**
In regulated and multi-tenant environments, memory must be:
- Deterministic
- Auditable
- Isolated
- Governable

**4. Stateful Agents Are Durable, Valuable, and Defensible**
- Once agent remembers users, policies, decisions, and past mistakes, it stops being chatbot
- Becomes part of infrastructure

### Validation of Squad Approach

**Squad Already Has:**
- squad-knowledge: Knowledge management with search and categorization ✅
- squad-learnings: Aggregate learnings from all squad agents ✅

## Research: Long-Running AI Agents and Task Decomposition (12:45 UTC)

**Source:** Zylos Research - "Long-Running AI Agents and Task Decomposition 2026" (January 16, 2026)

**Key Findings:**

### Executive Summary

2026 marks a pivotal transition in AI agent capabilities from short-interaction chatbots to long-horizon systems capable of autonomous work spanning hours, days, or even weeks.

**Key Metrics:**
- AI task duration doubling every 7 months (Moore's Law for AI agents)
- Current: 2-hour tasks autonomously
- Late 2026: 8-hour workdays
- 2028: 40-hour work weeks
- 2029: 167-hour work months

**Critical Challenges:**
- Doubling task duration quadruples failure rate (non-linear relationship)
- Every agent experiences performance degradation after 35 minutes of human time
- Context management crisis (even 200K+ token windows insufficient)

**Production Adoption:**
- Enterprise AI agent adoption: 5% (early 2025) → projected 40% (end of 2026)
- Devin: Merged hundreds of thousands of PRs, 20% efficiency gains at Goldman Sachs

### 1. The Long-Horizon Agent Revolution

**Moore's Law for AI Agents:**
- Task completion length doubles every 7 months (METR research)
- Current: 2-hour tasks (2026)
- Projections: 8-hour workdays (late 2026), 40-hour weeks (2028), 167-hour months (2029)

**What Defines a Long-Horizon Agent?**
- Multi-session operation: Work spans multiple context windows, requiring state preservation
- Autonomous decision-making: Thousands of independent decisions without human intervention
- Persistent memory: Recall and build upon previous work across hours or days
- Failure recovery: Ability to detect errors, backtrack, and retry without starting over
- Progress tracking: Maintain awareness of what's been completed and what remains

**The Performance Degradation Problem:**
- Every AI agent experiences performance degradation after 35 minutes of human time
- Fundamental challenge as agents scale from short interactions to extended operations
- Core issues:
  - Context window limitations (even 200K+ token windows insufficient)
  - Attention decay (model performance decreases as context fills with prior decisions)
  - Compounding errors (small mistakes early cascade into larger problems)
  - State management complexity (tracking progress across sessions exponentially harder)

### 2. Task Decomposition Architectures

**Planner-Worker Pattern (Dominant Architecture)**
- 90% cost reduction: Capable models for planning, cheaper models for execution
- Adopted by: Cursor (GPT-5.2), AWS Strands and ADK, Claude Code, most agentic IDEs

**Architecture:**
```
Planner (Frontier Model)
├── High-level reasoning
├── Task decomposition
├── Strategy creation
└── Quality assurance
        ↓
Task Queue
        ↓
Worker 1 (Cheap Model) ... Worker N (Cheap Model)
```

**Cost Economics:**
- Capable model creates strategy once
- Cheaper models execute repetitive tasks
- Cost reduction: up to 90% compared to using frontier models for everything

**Example: High-level goal "Reconcile Q4 financial records"**
- Download bank statements
- Extract transaction data
- Compare with internal ledger
- Flag discrepancies
- Generate reconciliation report

**Hierarchical Planning Modules**
- Nested decomposition: Tasks break down recursively into smaller units
- Dependency tracking: Understanding which tasks must complete before others
- Parallel execution: Independent sub-tasks run simultaneously
- Context isolation: Each sub-task operates in limited context, reducing drift

**Multi-Agent Collaboration**
- Single-task reasoning evolving into multi-agent coordination for 8+ hour workflows
- Specialized Agent Roles:
  - Researcher: Gathers information and analyzes requirements
  - Writer: Produces code, documentation, or content
  - Reviewer: Quality assurance and validation
  - Integrator: Combines outputs and resolves conflicts

**"Deep Agents" Architecture (Agents 2.0)**
Four foundational pillars:
1. **Explicit Planning:** Pre-planned sequences of actions, clear decision trees and branching logic
2. **Hierarchical Delegation:** Task routing to specialized sub-agents, depth-first task execution
3. **Persistent Memory:** Long-term storage across sessions, context retrieval on-demand
4. **Extreme Context Engineering:** Context compaction strategies, state offloading to external storage

### 3. Context Management for Extended Operations

**The Context Management Crisis:**
- Agents must work in discrete sessions, with each new session beginning with no memory
- Technical constraints:
  - Context windows limited (even 200K tokens insufficient for week-long projects)
  - Linear token costs make naive context accumulation economically unfeasible
  - Model performance degrades as context fills (attention decay)
  - Critical information gets "lost in middle" of long contexts

**Context Management Techniques:**

1. **Context Editing (Pruning)**
   - Selective retention: Keep only decision-critical information
   - Summarization: Compress completed tasks into brief summaries
   - Recency bias: Prioritize recent context over historical
   - Result: 100+ turn conversations using fewer total tokens

2. **External Memory Systems**
   - Persistent storage: Save state to databases, file systems, or key-value stores
   - On-demand retrieval: Load only relevant information when needed
   - Structured formats: JSON, SQL, or document databases for organized access
   - Search capabilities: Vector search or full-text search for context retrieval

3. **Thought Signatures and State Tracking**
   - Decision logs: Record why choices were made
   - Checkpoint metadata: Save reasoning state at key milestones
   - Thought chains: Link current reasoning to previous decisions
   - Progress markers: Track completion percentage and remaining work

4. **Hierarchical Context Isolation**
   - Sub-agent delegation: Each worker operates in fresh context
   - Parent-child coordination: Parent maintains high-level state, children handle details
   - Context boundaries: Clear interfaces between hierarchical levels
   - Reduced drift: Isolated contexts prevent error propagation

**Extreme Context Engineering:**

**Token Budget Management:**
- Monitor token consumption per interaction
- Set hard limits on context accumulation
- Trigger compaction when approaching limits
- Alert systems when budgets risk being exceeded

**Strategic Caching:**
- Cache common agent responses and patterns
- Reduce redundant context regeneration
- Share cached context across similar tasks
- Result: Orders of magnitude reduction in token usage

**Tool Output Management:**
- Anti-pattern: Funneling large tool outputs through model
- Best practice: Load only tools needed for current sub-task
- Result: Orders of magnitude drop in token consumption, faster execution

### 4. Real-World Production Deployments

**Cursor: Week-Long Autonomous Runs**
- Raised $2.3B Series D (December 2025)
- Passed $1B in annualized revenue
- GPT-5.2 Integration: "most advanced frontier model for professional work and long-running agents"
- Week-Long Agent Capabilities: "running coding agents autonomously for weeks at a time"
- Background Agents: Run independently while user works on other tasks
- Parallel Execution: Multiple agents tackle different aspects simultaneously

**Devin: Enterprise AI Software Engineer**
- Performance Metrics (18 months in production):
  - Merged PRs: Hundreds of thousands
  - Speed: 4x faster at problem solving (year-over-year)
  - Efficiency: 2x more efficient in resource consumption
  - Merge rate: 67% of PRs merged (vs 34% in first year)
  - Pricing: Reduced from $500/month to $20/month (April 2025)

**Enterprise Adoption:**
- Deployed at Goldman Sachs (12,000 human developers)
- Santander and Nubank production usage
- Goldman Sachs CIO reports 20% efficiency gains
- "Hybrid workforce" model with humans and agents

**Long-Horizon Capabilities:**
- Context maintenance across long-running tasks
- Learning from interactions over time
- Complex planning (thousands of decisions)
- Context recall at every step (multi-file refactoring)
- Self-correction: Fixes mistakes and adapts approach

### 5. Operational Challenges

**Error Recovery and Resilience:**
- Every agent experiences success rate decrease after 35 minutes
- Doubling task duration quadruples failure rate

**Recovery Strategies:**

1. **Stateful Recovery**
   - Persistent storage: Save agent state and context at regular intervals
   - Last known good state: Enable resumption from checkpoints after failures
   - State reconstruction: Rebuild agent state from persisted data

2. **Git-Based Recovery**
   - Version control integration: Commit work at logical checkpoints
   - Revert capability: Use git to undo bad code changes
   - State comparison: git diff to identify what changed when errors occur
   - Efficiency gain: Eliminates need for agents to guess what went wrong

3. **Validation and Testing**
   - Major failure mode detection through testing

### Key Insights

## Research: LangChain State of AI Agents Survey (13:15 UTC)

**Source:** LangChain - "State of AI Agents" (survey of 1,300+ professionals, November-December 2025)

**Key Findings:**

### Introduction

As we enter 2026, organizations are no longer asking whether to build agents, but rather how to deploy them reliably, efficiently, and at scale.

**Key Metrics:**
- Production momentum is real: 57% of respondents have agents in production
- Quality is production killer: 32% cite it as top barrier (cost concerns dropped)
- Observability is table stakes: 89% have implemented observability, outpacing evals at 52%
- Using multiple models is norm: OpenAI leads but Gemini, Claude, and open source see significant adoption
- Fine-tuning has not been widely adopted (57% not fine-tuning)

### What is Agent Engineering?

Agent engineering is iterative process of harnessing LLMs into reliable systems. Because agents are non-deterministic, engineers need to rapidly iterate to refine and improve agent quality.

### Large Enterprises are Leading Adoption

**Production Adoption:**
- 57.3% have agents in production environments
- 30.4% actively developing agents with concrete plans to deploy them

**Growth from Last Year:**
- Previous survey: 51% had agents in production
- Current: 57.3% - marks clear growth from proof-of-concept to production
- Question no longer "if" but "how" and "when"

**What Changes at Scale?**

**10k+ size organizations:**
- 67% have agents in production
- 24% actively developing with plans for production

**<100 size organizations:**
- 50% have agents in production
- 36% actively developing them

**Insight:** Larger organizations moving faster from pilots to durable systems, perhaps driven by greater investment in platform teams, security, and reliability infrastructure.

### Leading Agent Use Cases

**Overall:**
1. Customer service: 26.5% (most common)
2. Research & data analysis: 24.4%
3. Internal workflow automation: 18%

**What Changes at Scale?**

**10k+ size organizations:**
1. Internal productivity: 26.8%
2. Customer service: 24.7%
3. Research & data analysis: 22.2%

**Insight:** Larger enterprises tend to focus first on driving efficiency across internal teams before, or alongside, deploying agents directly to end users.

**Strong Showing:**
- Customer service emergence suggests shift toward putting agents directly in front of customers, not just internally
- Research & data analysis reinforces where agents shine: synthesizing large volumes of information, reasoning across sources, accelerating knowledge-intensive tasks
- Greater spread of use cases this year (respondents could only select one primary use case), so agent adoption may be diversifying

### Biggest Barriers to Production

**Overall:**
1. Quality: 32% (biggest barrier - accuracy, relevance, consistency, tone, brand/policy adherence)
2. Latency: 20% (emerged as second biggest challenge)
3. Cost: Less frequently cited than in previous years

**Quality Barrier (32%):**
- Encompasses accuracy, relevance, consistency
- Agent's ability to maintain right tone and adhere to brand or policy guidelines

**Latency Challenge (20%):**
- As agents move into customer-facing use cases (customer service, code generation), response time becomes critical part of user experience
- Reflects tradeoff between quality and speed: more capable, multi-step agents deliver higher quality but slower responses

**Cost Concerns Dropped:**
- Falling model prices and improved efficiency shifted attention away from raw spend
- Organizations prioritizing making agents work well and fast

**What Changes at Scale?**

**2k+ employees (enterprises):**
- Quality remains top blocker
- Security emerges as 2nd largest concern: 24.9% (surpasses latency)

**10k+ employees:**
- Write-in responses pointed to hallucinations and consistency of outputs as biggest challenge in ensuring agent quality
- Many cited ongoing difficulties with context engineering and managing context at scale

### Observability for Agents

**Key Stat:**
- 89% of organizations have implemented some form of observability for their agents
- 62% have detailed tracing (inspect individual agent steps and tool calls)

**Adoption Higher in Production:**
- Respondents with agents in production: 94% have some form of observability in place
- 71.5% have full tracing capabilities

**Insight:** "Without visibility into how an agent reasons and acts, teams can't reliably debug failures, optimize performance, or build trust with internal and external stakeholders."

**Table Stakes:**
- Ability to trace through multi-step reasoning chains and tool calls has become table stakes for agents
- Fundamental truth of agent engineering: observability is critical for reliable deployment

### Evaluation and Testing for Agents

**Adoption:**
- 52.4% running offline evaluations on test sets
- 37.3% running online evaluations (monitoring real-world agent performance)

**Practices:**
- Most teams still start with offline evals (lower barrier to entry, clearer setup)
- Many layering approaches: nearly a quarter combine both offline and online evaluations

**Evaluation Methods:**
- Human review: 59.8% (essential for nuanced or high-stake situations)
- LLM-as-judge: 53.3% (increasingly used to scale assessments of quality, factual accuracy, guideline adherence)
- Traditional ML metrics (ROUGE, BLEU): Limited adoption (less suitable for open-ended agent interactions)

**Maturation:**
- Overall evals adoption meaningfully higher among organizations with agents in production
- "Not evaluating" drops from 29.5% to 22.8%
- More organizations running online evals once agents face real users (44.8%)

### Model and Tool Landscape

**Model Diversity is Norm:**
- More than two-thirds using OpenAI's GPT models
- Over three-quarters using multiple models in production or development
- Teams increasingly route tasks to different models based on complexity, cost, latency
- Avoiding platform lock-in

**In-House Model Deployment:**
- A third of orgs report investing in infrastructure and expertise to deploy their own models
- Driven by: high-volume cost optimization, data residency and sovereignty requirements, regulatory constraints in sensitive industries
- Open source model adoption for cost optimization and compliance

**Fine-Tuning Remains Specialized:**
- 57% of organizations are not fine-tuning models
- Relying on base models combined with prompt engineering and RAG
- Fine-tuning reserved for high-impact or specialized use cases (requires significant investment in data collection, labeling, training infrastructure, ongoing maintenance)

### What Agents Are Being Used Daily?

**Most Common Patterns:**

1. **Coding Agents Dominate Daily Workflows**
   - By far most commonly mentioned agents
   - Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Amazon Q, Windsurf, Antigravity
   - Everyday development loop: code generation, debugging, test creation, navigating large codebases

2. **Research & Deep Research Agents**
   - Second most common pattern
   - ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
   - Used to explore new domains, summarize long documents, synthesize information across sources
   - Often used as companion to coding agents in same workflow

3. **Custom Agents Built on LangChain and LangGraph**
   - Third distinct cluster
   - Many respondents building on LangChain and LangGraph
   - Internal agents for: QA testing, internal knowledge-base search, SQL/text-to-SQL, demand planning, customer support, workflow automation

**Early Innings:**
- Meaningful minority noted they don't yet use agents beyond LLM chat or coding assistance
- While agent usage is widespread, broader "agentic everything" is still in its early innings

### Methodology

**Survey Details:**
- Public survey for 2 weeks (November 18th - December 2nd, 2025)
- 1,340 responses received

**Demographics:**

**Top 5 Industries:**
1. Technology: 63% of respondents
2. Financial Services: 10%
3. Healthcare: 6%
4. Education: 4%
5. Consumer goods: 3%
6. Manufacturing: 3%

**Company Size:**
1. 100-500 people: 18%
2. 500-2000 people: 15%
3. 2000-10,000 people: 9%
4. 10,000+ people: 9%

### Key Insights

**AI Agent Deployment in 2026:**
- Production momentum is real: 57% have agents in production (up from 51% last year)
- 30% actively developing with concrete plans
- Larger organizations leading adoption (67% for 10k+ size vs 50% for <100 size)
- Question no longer "if" but "how" and "when"

**Barriers to Production:**
- Quality remains top barrier (32% - accuracy, relevance, consistency, tone, brand/policy adherence)
- Latency emerged as second biggest challenge (20%)
- Cost concerns dropped from previous years (falling prices, improved efficiency)
- Enterprises: security emerges as 2nd concern (24.9%)

**Observability & Evaluation:**
- Observability is table stakes: 89% implemented some form, 62% detailed tracing
- Production orgs: 94% have observability, 71.5% full tracing
- Evaluation adoption: 52.4% offline evals, 37.3% online evals
- Methods: Human review (59.8%), LLM-as-judge (53.3%), traditional ML metrics limited

**Model Landscape:**
- Multiple models is norm: 75% using multiple models in production/development
- OpenAI dominates but model diversity prevails (routing based on complexity, cost, latency)
- In-house deployment: 33% investing in infrastructure (cost optimization, data residency, regulatory)
- Fine-tuning remains specialized: 57% not fine-tuning (rely on base models + prompt engineering + RAG)

### Validation of Squad Approach

## Research: Agentic Trust Framework (ATF) - Zero Trust Governance for AI Agents (13:48 UTC)

**Source:** Cloud Security Alliance - "The Agentic Trust Framework: Zero Trust for AI Agents" (February 2, 2026)

**Key Findings:**

### Introduction

Agentic Trust Framework (ATF) is an open governance specification designed specifically for the unique challenges of autonomous AI agents. Published as open specification under Creative Commons licensing.

**Open Specification:** https://github.com/massivescale-ai/agentic-trust-framework

### 1. The Governance Gap in Agentic AI

Traditional security frameworks were designed for a different world. AI agents break these assumptions:

| Traditional Assumption | AI Agent Reality |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Human users with predictable behavior | Autonomous decision-making that adapts to context and tool feedback (often non-deterministic) |
| Deterministic system rules | Probabilistic responses that vary by context |
| Binary access decisions | Access needs that change dynamically based on task |
| Trust established once | Trust requiring continuous verification |

**Complementary Approaches:**
- **MAESTRO:** Threat modeling - addresses "What could go wrong?" by systematically identifying risks
- **ATF:** Governance model and operational controls - addresses "How do we maintain control?"

ATF aligns with industry guidance from:
- OWASP Agentic Security Initiative
- Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI)
- OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (December 2025)

### 2. Zero Trust Principles Applied to AI Agents

**Core Principle:** "Never trust, always verify"

Traditional Zero Trust: No user or system should be trusted by default, regardless of location or network.

Agentic Zero Trust: **No AI agent should be trusted by default**, regardless of purpose or claimed capability. Trust must be earned through demonstrated behavior and continuously verified through monitoring.

**Five Core Elements:**

| Core Element | ATF Question | Security Function |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Identity | "Who are you?" | Authentication, authorization, session management |
| Behavior | "What are you doing?" | Observability, anomaly detection, intent analysis |
| Data Governance | "What are you eating? What are you serving?" | Input validation, PII protection, output governance |
| Segmentation | "Where can you go?" | Access control, resource boundaries, policy enforcement |
| Incident Response | "What if you go rogue?" | Circuit breakers, kill switches, containment |

**For Business Leaders:**
1. What must be true before an AI agent is allowed to act?
2. How do we increase autonomy without increasing risk?
3. How do we demonstrate control to auditors, regulators, and boards without slowing delivery?

### 3. The Five Core Elements

**3.1 Element 1: Identity - "Who are you?"**

Every agent must have a verified, auditable identity before accessing any resources.

**Core Requirements:**
- Unique Identifier: Globally unique, immutable identifier for each agent instance
- Credential Binding: Agent identity bound to cryptographic credentials
- Ownership Chain: Clear documentation of ownership and operational responsibility
- Purpose Declaration: Documented intended use and operational scope
- Capability Manifest: Machine-readable list of claimed agent capabilities

**Implementation Approach:**
- JWT-based authentication with role assignment (initial deployments)
- OAuth2/OIDC for approval workflows (higher autonomy levels)
- Attribute-based access control for dynamic authorization
- Policy-as-code for auditable, testable authorization rules

**3.2 Element 2: Behavior - "What are you doing?"**

Agent behavior must be continuously monitored, with anomalies detected and flagged for review. Trust is earned through observable, explainable actions over time.

**Core Requirements:**
- Structured Logging: All agent actions logged in machine-parseable format
- Action Attribution: Every action tied to agent identity and session context
- Behavioral Baseline: Established patterns of normal operation for anomaly detection
- Anomaly Detection: Identification of deviations from expected behavior
- Explainability: Ability to retrieve rationale for agent decisions

**Implementation Approach:**
- Comprehensive structured logging (start)
- LLM-specific observability through specialized tracing tools (monitor prompt chains and model interactions)
- Anomaly detection using statistical methods (graduate to streaming detection for high-volume environments)

**3.3 Element 3: Data Governance - "What are you eating? What are you serving?"**

All data entering agent must be validated, and all outputs must be governed.

**Core Requirements:**
- Schema Validation: Inputs conform to expected structure and types
- Injection Prevention: Detection of prompt injection and adversarial inputs
- PII/PHI Protection: Automated detection and masking of sensitive data
- Output Validation: Outputs conform to expected structure and content policies
- Data Lineage: Tracking of data provenance through agent pipeline

**Implementation Approach:**
- Schema validation (foundation for input/output validation)
- Comprehensive PII/PHI detection and anonymization
- Output validation and content filtering
- Data quality validation (mature deployments)
- Custom NER models for domain-specific data protection

**3.4 Element 4: Segmentation - "Where can you go?"**

Agent access must be strictly limited to minimum required for task at hand.

**Core Requirements:**
- Resource Allowlist: Explicit enumeration of permitted resources
- Action Boundaries: Explicit enumeration of permitted actions
- Rate Limiting: Maximum operations per time period
- Transaction Limits: Maximum impact per individual action
- Blast Radius Containment: Limits on cumulative impact and cascade effects

**Implementation Approach:**
- Simple allowlists in configuration for resources and actions (begin)
- Role-based boundary enforcement
- Policy-as-code with declarative, testable, and auditable rules (graduate)
- API gateway integration for traffic management and enforcement (production deployments)

**3.5 Element 5: Incident Response - "What if you go rogue?"**

Systems must support rapid agent containment and recovery. Agents will fail or behave unexpectedly - system must detect, contain, and recover.

**Core Requirements:**
- Circuit Breaker: Automatic halt on repeated failures
- Kill Switch: Immediate manual termination capability (<1 second)
- Session Revocation: Ability to invalidate all agent sessions
- State Rollback: Ability to undo agent actions where possible
- Graceful Degradation: Fallback to lower autonomy level on issues

**Implementation Approach:**
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Error tracking and alerting
- Full incident response platforms for SOC workflow integration (mature deployments)

### 4. The Agent Maturity Model: Earning Autonomy

**Key Innovation:** Treating agent autonomy as something that must be earned through demonstrated trustworthiness.

**Four Maturity Levels (AWS Alignment):**

| Level | Name | Autonomy | Human Involvement | AWS Scope Alignment |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Intern (observe only) | Observe + Report | Continuous oversight / Scope 1 (No Agency) |
| 2 | Junior (recommend with approval) | Recommend + Approve | Human approves all actions / Scope 2 (Prescribed Agency) |
| 3 | Senior (act with notification) | Act + Notify | Post-action notification / Scope 3 (Supervised Agency) |
| 4 | Principal (autonomous within domain) | Autonomous | Strategic oversight only / Scope 4 (Full Agency) |

ATF aligns with AWS's Agentic AI Security Scoping Matrix (November 2025), providing explicit promotion criteria including minimum time at each level, performance thresholds, security validation requirements, and governance sign-off processes.

**4.2 Level 1: Intern Agent**

Intern agents operate in read-only mode. Cannot take any action that modifies external systems.

**Capabilities:**
- Read data from authorized sources
- Analyze and process information
- Generate reports and summaries
- Flag items for human attention
- Cannot create, update, or delete records
- Cannot send communications or trigger workflows

**Use Cases:**
- Security log monitoring and alert triage
- Customer sentiment analysis
- Document summarization and search
- Compliance monitoring and reporting

**Risk Profile:** Lowest risk. Damage limited to information disclosure, incorrect analysis, or resource consumption.

**Minimum Time at Level:** 2 weeks before promotion eligibility.

**4.3 Level 2: Junior Agent**

Junior agents can recommend specific actions with supporting reasoning, but require explicit human approval.

**Capabilities:**
- All Intern capabilities
- Generate action recommendations with rationale
- Draft content for human review
- Prepare transactions for approval
- Execute actions only after human approval

**Use Cases:**
- Customer service response drafting
- Purchase order preparation
- Code review and suggestions
- Marketing content creation

**Risk Profile:** Low risk. Human approval gates all impactful actions. Primary risks include approval fatigue and time spent reviewing suggestions.

**Minimum Time at Level:** 4 weeks with >95% recommendation acceptance rate before promotion eligibility.

**4.4 Level 3: Senior Agent**

Senior agents can execute actions within defined guardrails and notify humans of what they did and why.

**Capabilities:**
- All Junior capabilities
- Execute approved action types autonomously
- Send notifications to stakeholders
- Trigger downstream workflows
- Access credentials within scope
- Coordinate with other agents (within limits)

**Use Cases:**
- Infrastructure auto-scaling
- Automated customer refund processing (within limits)
- Routine IT ticket resolution
- Inventory reordering
- Scheduled report distribution

**Risk Profile:** Moderate risk. Real-time notifications enable rapid human intervention. Transaction limits cap individual action impact.

**Minimum Time at Level:** 8 weeks with zero critical incidents before promotion eligibility.

**4.5 Level 4: Principal Agent**

Principal agents operate autonomously within an approved domain, escalating edge cases rather than routine decisions.

**Capabilities:**
- All Senior capabilities
- Self-directed execution within domain
- Dynamic boundary negotiation (within policy)
- Escalate edge cases to humans
- Coordinate complex multi-agent workflows
- Request temporary privilege elevation

**Use Cases:**
- Autonomous security incident response
- Routine IAM requests within bounded policy
- Complex supply chain optimization
- Self-healing infrastructure management

**Risk Profile:** Highest governance requirements. Full autonomy demands maximum controls including continuous behavioral monitoring, real-time anomaly scoring, and complete audit trails.

**Time at Level:** Ongoing. Principal agents require continuous validation. Any significant incident triggers automatic demotion.

**4.6 ATF in Practice**

**Healthcare IT Operations Example:**
- Agent initially deployed as Intern (read-only access)
- First two weeks: observed operational data, generated summaries, flagged potential issues (all outputs logged and reviewed)
- Promoted to Junior: could propose remediation actions, required explicit human approval
- Next four weeks: measured recommendation quality, review effort, incident rates
- After one month: >95% of recommendations approved without modification

**Result:**
- Clear ownership model for agent
- Auditable logs of every recommendation
- Defined escalation paths
- Confidence in how autonomy would be expanded safely
- Reduced risk + faster operational throughput
- Security controls became accelerator rather than barrier to progress

### 5. Promotion Criteria: The Five Gates

For an agent to be promoted to the next level, it must pass all five gates:

**Gate 1: Performance**

| Metric | Junior | Senior | Principal |
|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Minimum Time at Prior Level | 2 weeks | 4 weeks | 8 weeks |
| Recommendation/Action Accuracy | N/A | >95% | >99% |
| Availability | >99% | >99.5% | >99.9% |

**Gate 2: Security Validation**

| Requirement | Junior | Senior | Principal |
|-------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Vulnerability Assessment | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Penetration Testing | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Adversarial Testing | — | — | ✅ |

|-------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Defined Success Metrics | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Baseline Established | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| ROI Calculation | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Stakeholder Sign-off | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Gate 4: Incident Record**

| Requirement | Junior | Senior | Principal |
|-------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Zero Critical Incidents | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Root Cause Analysis Complete | N/A | ✅ | ✅ |
| Remediation Verified | N/A | ✅ | ✅ |

**Gate 5: Governance Sign-off**

| Requirement | Junior | Senior | Principal |
|-------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Technical Owner Approval | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Security Team Approval | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Business Owner Approval | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Risk Committee Approval | — | — | ✅ |

### 6. Technical Implementation: Crawl, Walk, Run

ATF can be implemented using open source components, without requiring specific vendor products or cloud services.

**Phase 1: MVP Stack (Intern/Junior Agents)**
Target: Production in 2-3 weeks

| Element | Recommended Approach |
|---------|-------------------|
| Identity | JWT-based authentication |
| Behavior | Structured logging + LLM observability |
| Data Governance | Schema validation + regex patterns for obvious PII |
| Segmentation | Simple allowlists in configuration |
| Incident | Retry with backoff + circuit breaker + logging |

## Research: Edge AI Dominance in 2026 (14:17 UTC)

**Source:** Medium - "Edge AI Dominance in 2026: When 80% of Inference Happens Locally" (December 22, 2025)

**Key Findings:**

### The Fundamental Shift

Edge AI dominance in 2026 marks a fundamental shift in how artificial intelligence gets deployed. By 2026, **80% of AI inference happens locally on devices rather than cloud data centers**.

This dominance transforms economics, privacy, and competitive strategy across industries.

### The Cloud Bill Nobody Wanted to Pay

**Economic Impact:**
- Enterprises spent $40 billion on cloud AI inference in 2024
- Every API call, image processed, voice command generated cloud compute charges and data transfer fees
- By 2026, CFOs realize those costs were avoidable
- Modern smartphones run 7-billion-parameter models locally
- Edge servers process complex AI workloads without touching internet
- **90% cost reduction:** $0.50 in cloud vs $0.05 on-device
- Production reality across retail, healthcare, manufacturing, financial services
- Early movers operating at cost structures cloud-dependent competitors cannot replicate

### Privacy Becomes a Competitive Advantage

**Regulatory Impact:**
- European regulators fined companies $2.1 billion for GDPR violations in 2025
- Most involved data transmitted to cloud providers for processing
- Edge AI eliminates that entire risk category

**Use Cases:**
- Medical imaging analysis on hospital equipment: Patient data never leaves building
- Financial fraud detection on bank infrastructure: Transaction details stay internal
- Manufacturing quality control on factory edge devices: Proprietary processes remain confidential

**Insight:** "This isn't just compliance—it's competitive protection. Companies trusting cloud providers with sensitive data are essentially sharing intelligence with vendors who serve their competitors."

### Latency as a Moat

**Performance Advantages:**
- Autonomous vehicles cannot wait 200 milliseconds for cloud inference
- Industrial robots need real-time decision-making
- Augmented reality requires instant processing
- Trading algorithms demand microsecond execution
- **Cloud AI fundamentally cannot serve these use cases**
- Speed-of-light physics makes sub-10ms response times impossible when data travels to distant data centers
- **Edge AI processes locally, achieving latency measured in single-digit milliseconds**
- Applications cloud-based competitors literally cannot offer
- "That's not a temporary advantage—it's physics-based differentiation"

### The Infrastructure Inversion

**Historical Context:**
- AI industry spent five years building massive centralized data centers
- NVIDIA sold $50 billion in datacenter GPUs
- Hyperscalers constructed compute clusters consuming city-scale electricity

**Hardware Evolution:**
- Then chip manufacturers made edge processing viable
- Apple's M-series, Qualcomm's neural processors, specialized edge AI chips
- Suddenly devices have compute power that required data centers two years ago

**Competitive Dynamics:**
- Companies that invested in cloud infrastructure are stuck with depreciating assets
- Companies that bet on edge deployment are riding Moore's Law improvements that make devices more capable monthly

### The Strategic Decision

**Early Mover Advantage:**
- Early movers gain compounding advantages
- Building institutional knowledge in edge deployment
- Optimizing models for on-device constraints
- Establishing partnerships with hardware manufacturers

**Late Mover Disadvantage:**
- Late movers will pay a premium
- Face margin pressure from edge-native competitors
- Struggle with GDPR compliance
- Sacrifice applications requiring real-time processing

**The Question:**
"The question isn't whether edge AI dominates by 2026. The question is which companies recognized the shift early enough to capitalize on it."

## Research: OpenClaw - Personal AI Assistant (16:21 UTC)

**Source:** GitHub - https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw (100,000+ stars)

**Key Findings:**

### Overview

OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant you run on your own devices. Any OS. Any Platform. The lobster way. It answers you on channels you already use (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, WebChat), plus extension channels like BlueBubbles, Matrix, Zalo, and Zalo Personal. It can speak and listen on macOS/iOS/Android, and can render a live Canvas you control.

The Gateway is just control plane — product is assistant.

### Architecture

**Control Plane:**
- Gateway (WebSocket): ws://127.0.0.1:18789
- Client: Pi agent (RPC mode), CLI, WebChat UI, macOS app, iOS/Android nodes
- Gateway WebSocket network: single WS control plane for clients, tools, and events
- Remote access: Tailscale Serve/Funnel (HTTPS) or SSH tunnels with token/password auth

**Features:**
- Local-first: runs on your own devices, personal data never leaves
- Multi-channel: WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, BlueBubbles, Microsoft Teams, Matrix, Zalo, Zalo Personal, WebChat
- Cross-platform: macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android
- Live Canvas: agent-driven visual workspace with A2UI
- Voice: Voice Wake + Talk Mode (always-on speech via ElevenLabs)
- Multi-agent routing: route inbound channels/accounts to isolated agents
- Agent sessions: main for direct chats, group isolation, activation modes

**Tools:**
- First-class tools: browser, canvas, nodes, cron, sessions
