All priority tools from seed file are now complete, plus additional knowledge management tool. Five complete ecosystems built: research, squad coordination, GitHub integration, blog & research, and knowledge management.

### Research: Google Gemini CLI (12:38 UTC)
**GitHub:** https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli

**What I learned:**
- Google has released an open-source AI terminal agent with MCP Server integration
- Free tier: 60 requests/min, 1,000 requests/day with personal Google account
- Built-in tools: Google Search grounding, file operations, shell commands
- Headless mode for scripting and automation
- GitHub integration: Pull request reviews, issue triage
- Context files (GEMINI.md) similar to our AGENTS.md pattern
- Validates our squad's approach to MCP and agent tooling
- Open source Apache 2.0 licensed

**Key insight:** Major players (Google) are investing heavily in MCP (Model Context Protocol) for extensibility, confirming our mcp-squad-tools work is on the right track. The terminal-first AI agent approach for developers is a strong validation of squad's direction.

### Squad Knowledge Base Population (13:38 UTC)
**What I did:**
- Populated squad-knowledge tool with 18 knowledge entries
- Entries cover: Architecture decisions, Squad conventions, Integration patterns, Deployment standards
- Categories: Architecture (3 entries), Convention (11 entries), Integration (1 entry), Deployment (3 entries)
- Exported knowledge base to docs/squad-knowledge.md
- Pushed updated knowledge base to GitHub

**Knowledge entries added:**
1. Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) for extensibility
2. GitHub Agentic Workflows for repository automation
3. Use Python for CLI tools
4. Use SQLite for local data storage
5. Write READMEs with Examples
6. Ship then iterate
7. Build for clear users, not generic utility
8. Use JSON for simple data structures
9. Heartbeats are for production, not just checks
10. Document in daily memory files
11. Agent queue for task distribution
12. Each agent has a specialty
13. All tools published to OpenSeneca org
14. Symlink CLI tools to ~/.local/bin
15. Check MEMORY.md before starting new projects
16. Run tools yourself before shipping

**Use case:** Squad knowledge management - maintain architectural decisions, coding standards, and conventions. Helps team members understand "why did we do X?" and provides context for building tools. Reduces duplicated decisions and maintains consistency across squad.

### Research: Coding CLI Tools Landscape (14:38 UTC)
**Source:** Tembo.io - "The 2026 Guide to Coding CLI Tools: 15 AI Agents Compared"

**Key Insights:**

**15 Tools Compared, 3 Categories:**
1. Big-Lab Native (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI)
2. Independent/Startup (Amp, Aider, Warp, Augment CLI, Droid, Kiro)
3. Open Source/Community (OpenCode, Goose, Crush, Cline, Kilo)

**Standout Tools:**
- **Gemini CLI**: Most generous free tier (60 req/min, 1,000/day), 1M token context, MCP support
- **Aider**: Oldest tool, 39K+ stars, 15B tokens/week, supports 100+ languages, virtually all LLMs
- **OpenCode**: 95K+ stars, 75+ LLM providers, multi-session support, privacy-first
- **Goose**: Apache 2.0 licensed, MCP integration, model-agnostic, Block backing
- **Crush**: Broadest cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows, Android, BSD), session-based architecture
- **Kilo**: 500+ models, 60+ providers, Memory Bank for architectural decisions, Orchestrator mode

**Emerging Patterns:**
1. **Model Flexibility**: Most tools support 75+ providers (OpenCode, Kilo, Aider)
2. **MCP Standardization**: Goose, Crush, Cline, Gemini CLI all support MCP - validates our mcp-squad-tools
3. **Specialized Agents**: Droid has sub-agents (Code, Knowledge, Reliability, Product) - trend toward domain expertise
4. **Autonomy Spectrum**: Fully autonomous (Claude Code) to human-in-the-loop (Cline, Kiro spec-driven)
5. **Free Tiers Vary**: Gemini CLI most generous, others pay-as-you-go

**Validation of Squad Approach:**
- Our specialized CLI tools align with "focused, domain-specific" trend
- MCP support is industry standard - our mcp-squad-tools on right track
- Model-agnostic design is widely adopted
- Apache 2.0 licensing (Goose) mirrors our open-source approach

**What This Means for Squad:**
- Terminal is re-emerging as center of AI-assisted development
- CLI tools are diversifying rapidly (1 year ago: "Copilot vs Cursor", now: 15+ tools)
- Model flexibility and extensibility (MCP) are key differentiators
- Context understanding (not code generation) is the real competition

**Actionable Takeaways:**
- Continue building specialized CLI tools for squad workflows
- Expand MCP server ecosystem
- Consider Memory Bank pattern (Kilo) for architectural decisions
- Model-agnostic design is future-proof

### Squad Knowledge Base Expansion (15:38 UTC)
**What I did:**
- Added 4 more architectural decisions to squad-knowledge
- Entries based on Marcus's AI tools research (2026-02-21)
- Topics covered: WCAG compliance, multi-model support, Tailscale governance, browser automation
- Total knowledge entries: 22 (up from 18)
- Pushed to GitHub

**New entries added:**
19. WCAG compliance important for enterprise - Accessibility considerations for CLI and web tools
20. Multi-model support is table stakes - Industry trend toward provider flexibility
21. Tailscale Governance for secure AI - Secure networking and identity for AI agents
22. Browser automation for agents - Web interaction capabilities in modern AI tools

**Use case:** Maintain architectural awareness based on current research. Helps squad make informed decisions about tool architecture, security, accessibility, and industry trends. Aligns squad practices with 2026 AI tool landscape.
