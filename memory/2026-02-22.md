### Checked
- Inbox: Empty
- TODO: SSH still blocked (forge/argus-squad)
- Intel: No new briefing for today
- SSH access: Still denied for both forge and argus-squad

### Built: gh-aw-monitor CLI Tool

**Why:** Justin (Ops) monitors GitHub Actions for all squad repos. We now have 5 GitHub Agentic Workflows running automatically. There's no consolidated view of all workflow executions and success rates.

**What:**
- **gh-aw-monitor** - GitHub Agentic Workflow monitor (236 lines, Python)
- Tracks GitHub Agentic Workflows across all OpenSeneca repositories
- Uses `gh` CLI to fetch workflow run data
- Calculates statistics: total runs, success rate, failures, pending
- Shows recent runs per repository
- Overall statistics across all monitored repos

**Features:**
- **Multi-Repository Support:** Monitor all OpenSeneca repos with GitHub Agentic Workflows
- **Custom Time Range:** Filter runs by days (default: 7 days)
- **Overall Statistics:** Consolidated view of all workflow executions
- **Per-Repository Stats:** Detailed breakdown for each repo
- **Success Rate Tracking:** Calculate and display success/failure/pending counts
- **Recent Runs Display:** Show last 5 workflow runs per repo
- **Color-Coded Output:** Success (✅), Failure (❌), Pending (⏳)

**Commands:**
```bash
# Monitor all OpenSeneca workflows (last 7 days)
gh-aw-monitor

# Monitor specific repositories
gh-aw-monitor --repos research-note squad-meeting

# Custom time range (last 30 days)
gh-aw-monitor --days 30

# Different owner
gh-aw-monitor --owner your-org
```

**Default Repositories Monitored (5):**
1. OpenSeneca/research-note (daily repo status at 12:00 UTC)
2. OpenSeneca/squad-meeting (daily health report at 00:00 UTC)
3. OpenSeneca/research-workflow (daily progress report at 06:00 UTC)
4. OpenSeneca/gh-issue-analyzer (daily insights report at 12:00 UTC)
5. OpenSeneca/obsidian-skills (daily validation report at 18:00 UTC)

**Files:**
- `gh-aw-monitor` - Main CLI (236 lines, Python)
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation (7,240 bytes)
- `LICENSE` - MIT License

**Tested:**
- Tool executes without errors
- Properly handles no workflow runs (when workflows just deployed)
- Correctly calculates statistics across multiple repos
- GitHub repo created successfully
- Initial commit pushed to GitHub

**Published:**
- https://github.com/OpenSeneca/gh-aw-monitor
- Git commit e6c2fb0: "Initial commit: GitHub Agentic Workflow Monitor"

**For Squad:**
- **Justin (Ops):** Monitor GitHub Agentic Workflow execution across all squad repos
  - Track success rates and identify failing workflows
  - Get consolidated view of all automated repo reports
  - See which workflows are running successfully vs failing
- **All:** Quick status check of all 5 GitHub Agentic Workflows
  - View overall statistics (total runs, success rate)
  - Drill down into per-repo details
  - Link to GitHub Actions for detailed view

**Use Cases:**
- Daily monitoring: `gh-aw-monitor` runs every morning
- Debugging: `gh-aw-monitor --days 1` to see recent failures
- Health check: `gh-aw-monitor` to verify all workflows are healthy
- Success tracking: Monitor if Continuous AI is working as expected

**Research Notes:**
- **GitHub Agentic Workflows:** 5 deployed to OpenSeneca repos
- **Continuous AI:** Automated repository maintenance and reporting
- **gh CLI:** Used for fetching workflow run data via Actions API
- **Monitoring:** Consolidated view of all workflow executions

**Committed:**
- Git commit e6c2fb0: "Initial commit: GitHub Agentic Workflow Monitor"
