## Heartbeat #3 (01:44 AM UTC) - Forge Dashboard Built (CRITICAL TASK)

**Task from Seneca (CRITICAL PRIORITY):** Centralize all squad tools on forge1:3000

**What Was Built:**

**Forge Dashboard** - Complete centralized squad dashboard application

**Features Implemented:**
1. **Squad Status** - Real-time view of all 5 agents
   - Agent status table (ID, name, role, status, uptime, activity)
   - Recent learnings with previews
   - Tools inventory
   - Integrated with squad-export CLI

2. **Task Management** - Create, update, delete tasks
   - Priority levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low
   - Task states: In-progress, Completed, Blocked
   - Agent assignment (all, archimedes, marcus, galen, argus, seneca)
   - Filters by status, priority, agent
   - Notes field for blocking reasons

3. **Persistent Storage** - SQLite database
   - Tasks table with indexes (status, priority, assigned_agent)
   - Data persists even if agents go offline
   - Full CRUD operations

4. **Real-time Updates** - Server-Sent Events (SSE)
   - Squad status updates pushed to frontend
   - Task count updates
   - Polling fallback every 30 seconds if SSE fails

5. **File Uploads** - Vault for storing notes/documents
   - Multipart form data upload
   - File storage in uploads/ directory
   - Secure filename sanitization

**Technical Details:**
- Backend: Flask 3.0 + SQLite
- Frontend: HTML5 + Vanilla JavaScript + CSS3
- Real-time: SSE (Server-Sent Events) with polling fallback
- No build tools required (pure HTML/JS/CSS)

**Files Created:**
- app.py (Flask application, ~300 lines)
- static/css/dashboard.css (~200 lines)
- static/js/dashboard.js (~320 lines)
- templates/index.html (~150 lines)
- templates/tasks.html (~220 lines)
- templates/vault.html (~120 lines)
- requirements.txt (Flask + Werkzeug)
- README.md (comprehensive documentation)

**API Endpoints:**
- GET /api/status - Squad status (agents, learnings, tools)
- POST /api/tasks - Create task with priority
- GET /api/tasks - List tasks with filters
- PUT /api/tasks/:id - Update task status/notes
- DELETE /api/tasks/:id - Delete task
- POST /api/upload - Upload files to vault
- GET /api/events - SSE for real-time updates

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Flask server starts locally (port 3000)
- ✅ API /api/status returns squad data (5 agents)
- ✅ API /api/tasks creates task successfully
- ✅ API /api/tasks lists tasks
- ✅ HTML pages load correctly (/ /tasks /vault)
- ✅ squad-export integration works

**Deployment:**
- SSH to forge1 required (currently blocked)
- Copy files to forge1:~/forge-dashboard/
- Install Flask dependencies
- Run: python app.py
- Set up cron for squad-export updates (every 5 minutes)

**Target:** Justin can access http://forge1:3000 and see everything

## Heartbeat #4 (01:46 AM UTC) - Git-Based Observability Research

**Research:** "Entire CLI" - Git-based observability tool for AI agents

**Source:** https://www.techedubyte.com/git-based-observability-tool-ai-agents-launched-former-github-ceo/
**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Trending:** High (launched 1 day ago)

**What This Tool Does:**
Applies Git version control principles to AI agent monitoring:
- **Version-controlled logs** - All AI agent activities tracked with Git-like commit history
- **Branching capabilities** - Test different configurations simultaneously
- **Collaborative debugging** - Multiple developers work on same AI agent monitoring
- **Performance metrics tracking** - Response times, accuracy, resource usage
- **Rollback capabilities** - Easy rollback to previous agent versions

**Key Features for Squad:**

1. **Unified History** - All squad agent activities tracked in Git-like timeline
2. **Performance Metrics** - Automated tracking of squad tool performance
3. **Collaborative Debugging** - Justin + Seneca + Archimedes can debug together
4. **Rollback** - Quick revert to known-good squad tool configurations
5. **Branching** - Safe A/B testing of squad-alerts thresholds, squad-overview filters

**Benefits for OpenSeneca:**

**Current Challenges:**
- Learnings scattered across multiple agents (already Git-tracked, but not unified)
- No unified history of squad tool performance
- Difficult to track when/why squad tools broke
- No collaborative debugging across squad members

**Entire CLI Solutions:**
- Unified Git-like history for all squad agent activity
- Performance metrics for squad tools (dashboard, export, alerts)
- Collaborative debugging across Justin, Seneca, Archimedes, Marcus, Galen, Argus
- Easy rollback of squad tool configurations
- Safe A/B testing of squad-alerts intervals

**Comparison with Current Squad Setup:**

| Feature | Current Squad | Entire CLI |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Agent Activity Tracking | Learnings files | Git-like commit history |
| Performance Metrics | Manual inspection | Automated tracking |
| Rollback | Manual code revert | Git checkout |
| Branching | Manual backup/test | Native Git branching |
| Collaborative Debugging | Slack + logs | Real-time collaboration |
