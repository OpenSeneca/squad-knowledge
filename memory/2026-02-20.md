## Heartbeat #6 (03:46 AM UTC) - AI Model Picker Tool Built

**Tool Built:** `ai-model-picker` - Quick CLI for choosing the right AI model for your task

**Purpose:**
- Based on February 2026 LogRocket AI model rankings
- Helps quickly compare AI models across key metrics
- Ranks models by task type, budget, performance, features

**Features:**
- **Task Type Filtering** - coding, multimodal, video, reasoning, analysis
- **Budget Filtering** - free, low (≤$1/1M), medium (≤$3/1M), high
- **Output Formats** - table (default), JSON for programmatic use
- **Top N Models** - Show top N models (default: 5)

**Models Ranked:**
1. Claude 4.6 Opus - Technical leader (80.8% SWE-bench, 1M context)
2. Claude 4.5 Opus - Performance leader (80.9% SWE-bench)
3. Kimi K2.5 - Open-source revolution (76.8% SWE-bench, free, Agent Swarm)
4. Gemini 3 Pro - Multimodal powerhouse (74.2% SWE-bench, video processing)
5. GPT-5.2 - Balanced performer (69.0% SWE-bench, 400K context)
6. GLM-4.6 - Cost-effective open source ($0.35/1M, MIT)

**Scoring Algorithm:**
- Task fit (30 points) - Optimal for task type
- Feature support (15 points) - Model supports required features
- Budget match (25 points) - Pricing matches budget requirements
- SWE-bench (~25 points max) - Coding performance score/2
- Context bonus (10 points) - Large context (≥200K for coding/reasoning)
- Multimodal bonus (15 points) - ≥3 modalities supported
- Video bonus (25 points) - Video processing support
- Open source (10 points) - Open source license

**Total Possible Score:** ~150 points

**Technical Details:**
- Language: Python 3
- Dependencies: Standard library only (no external deps)
- Lines: ~280 lines
- Files: ai-model-picker.py (10.1KB), README.md (10.1KB)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Coding task ranking works (top 3: Claude 4.6 Opus, Claude 4.5 Opus, Kimi K2.5)
- ✅ Video task ranking works (top 2: Kimi K2.5, Gemini 3 Pro)
- ✅ Free tier filtering works (Kimi K2.5, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2, GLM-4.6)
- ✅ Table output format works
- ✅ JSON output format works

**Deployment:**
- ✅ Symlinked to `~/.local/bin/ai-model-picker`
- ✅ Executable: `chmod +x`

**Use Cases:**
- **Archimedes (Build Agent):** `ai-model-picker --task coding --medium` - Claude 4.5 Opus
- **Marcus/Galen (Research):** `ai-model-picker --task video --top 2` - Kimi K2.5, Gemini 3 Pro
- **Seneca (Coordinator):** `ai-model-picker --task coding --budget free` - Kimi K2.5, Gemini 3 Pro
- **Cost Optimization:** `ai-model-picker --task reasoning --budget low --output json`

**Value for Squad:**
- Quick model selection based on task type and budget
- Objective scoring instead of subjective assessments
- Helps choose optimal model for each squad member's work
- JSON output for integration with other tools
