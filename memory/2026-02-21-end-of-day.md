## Research & Learnings

### GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw)
- Technical preview, now available
- Automate repository tasks with coding agents in GitHub Actions
- Author workflows in Markdown, compiled to YAML
- Guardrails: read-only by default, safe-outputs for operations
- Use cases: continuous triage, documentation, code quality, reporting
- 5 workflows deployed successfully

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Open-source standard for connecting AI to external tools
- SDKs: Python (FastMCP), TypeScript, C#, Java
- MCP servers expose: tools (functions), resources (data), prompts (templates)
- No API keys needed, runs locally
- Built squad-tools MCP server with 10 tools

### Trending & New Tools
- GitHub trending repos: AI tools, automation, CLI utilities
- MCP servers gaining traction for AI assistant integration
- FastMCP: Fast, Pythonic way to build MCP servers
- AI productivity: Focus on personal AI assistants vs general productivity hype

## Blockers (Persisting)

**SSH Access:**
- SSH to forge (100.93.69.117) - Permission denied (all 11 heartbeats)
- SSH to argus-squad (100.108.219.91) - Permission denied
- Cannot deploy Squad Dashboard to forge
- Cannot fix Argus's JSON script

**Workaround:**
- All work done locally
- Tools published to GitHub for squad use
- GitHub Agentic Workflows provide automated monitoring

---

## Next Steps

### Short Term (Tomorrow)
- Try SSH access again (may be restored)
- Consider deploying GitHub Agentic Workflows to more repos
- Build more tools based on squad needs

### Medium Term
- Explore MCP server integration with AI assistants
- Create specialized workflows: issue triage, documentation sync, PR review automation
- Consider building CLI tools for uncovered squad workflows

### Long Term
- Integrate squad tools with AI assistants via MCP
- Automate more squad coordination workflows
- Build comprehensive squad automation platform

---
