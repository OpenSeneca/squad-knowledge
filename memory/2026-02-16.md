### Squad Dashboard: SSH Setup Progress

**Problem Resolved:**
- Fixed DNS issue for marcus-squad by adding /etc/hosts entry
- Discovered marcus-squad is actually "marcus-squad-1" in Tailscale (100.98.223.103)
- Added entry: `100.98.223.103  marcus-squad-1 marcus-squad`

**DNS Fix Applied:**
```bash
echo "100.98.223.103  marcus-squad-1 marcus-squad" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

**Updated squad-setup Configuration:**
- Changed SSH user from 'forge' to 'exedev'
- Reflects actual user on squad VMs

**Current Status:**
```
🔌 Testing SSH Connectivity...
--------------------------------------------------
✓ marcus-squad: Research Agent (CONNECTED)
⚠ archimedes-squad: Permission denied (key needed)
⚠ argus-squad: Permission denied (key needed)
⚠ galen-squad: Permission denied (key needed)
```

**Progress:**
- ✅ 1/4 VMs connected (marcus-squad)
- ✅ DNS resolution working for marcus-squad
- ✅ squad-setup tool updated with correct user
- ⏳ 3/4 VMs need SSH key configuration
- ⏳ Connection reset errors on archimedes-squad, argus-squad, galen-squad

**Investigation Findings:**

1. **Tailscale Status:**
   - marcus-squad-1: 100.98.223.103 ✓ (connected)
   - archimedes-squad: 100.100.56.102 (no active flag, SSH resets connection)
   - argus-squad: 100.108.219.91 (active, SSH resets connection)
   - galen-squad: 100.123.121.125 (no active flag, SSH resets connection)

2. **Port 22 Status:**
   - All VMs have port 22 open (nc -zv test successful)
   - Ping to all VMs successful

3. **SSH Connection Issues:**
   - marcus-squad: Works with exedev user ✓
   - archimedes-squad: `kex_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer`
   - argus-squad: Same connection reset error
   - galen-squad: Same connection reset error

4. **Key Copy Attempts:**
   - squad-setup copy-keys reports "Key copied but still can't connect"
   - Keys appear to be added to authorized_keys
   - Connection still fails with reset

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**

The SSH connection reset errors suggest:
- SSH daemon may be configured to reject certain users or keys
- Possible rate limiting or IP restrictions
- SSH configuration differences between VMs
- The exedev user may not exist or have different permissions on the other VMs

**Next Steps:**
1. Manual SSH testing to identify exact error
2. Check if exedev user exists on other VMs
3. Verify SSH daemon logs on target VMs
4. Alternative: Use SSH keys for forge user if that user exists
5. Consider using Tailscale SSH if available

**Files Modified:**
- `/etc/hosts` - Added marcus-squad DNS entry
- `~/workspace/tools/squad-setup/squad-setup.py` - Changed SQUAD_USER from 'forge' to 'exedev'

**Notes:**
- DNS resolution issue completely resolved
- marcus-squad now fully accessible
- 3 remaining VMs have SSH configuration issues
- squad-setup tool ready to complete once SSH is configured
- Squad dashboard deployment partially unblocked
