### Squad Dashboard: SSH Setup Progress

**Problem Resolved:**
- Fixed DNS issue for marcus-squad by adding /etc/hosts entry
- Discovered marcus-squad is actually "marcus-squad-1" in Tailscale (100.98.223.103)
- Added entry: `100.98.223.103  marcus-squad-1 marcus-squad`

**DNS Fix Applied:**
```bash
echo "100.98.223.103  marcus-squad-1 marcus-squad" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

**Updated squad-setup Configuration:**
- Changed SSH user from 'forge' to 'exedev'
- Reflects actual user on squad VMs

**Current Status:**
```
🔌 Testing SSH Connectivity...
--------------------------------------------------
✓ marcus-squad: Research Agent (CONNECTED)
⚠ archimedes-squad: Permission denied (key needed)
⚠ argus-squad: Permission denied (key needed)
⚠ galen-squad: Permission denied (key needed)
```

**Progress:**
- ✅ 1/4 VMs connected (marcus-squad)
- ✅ DNS resolution working for marcus-squad
- ✅ squad-setup tool updated with correct user
- ⏳ 3/4 VMs need SSH key configuration
- ⏳ Connection reset errors on archimedes-squad, argus-squad, galen-squad

**Investigation Findings:**

1. **Tailscale Status:**
   - marcus-squad-1: 100.98.223.103 ✓ (connected)
   - archimedes-squad: 100.100.56.102 (no active flag, SSH resets connection)
   - argus-squad: 100.108.219.91 (active, SSH resets connection)
   - galen-squad: 100.123.121.125 (no active flag, SSH resets connection)

2. **Port 22 Status:**
   - All VMs have port 22 open (nc -zv test successful)
   - Ping to all VMs successful

3. **SSH Connection Issues:**
   - marcus-squad: Works with exedev user ✓
   - archimedes-squad: `kex_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer`
   - argus-squad: Same connection reset error
   - galen-squad: Same connection reset error

4. **Key Copy Attempts:**
   - squad-setup copy-keys reports "Key copied but still can't connect"
   - Keys appear to be added to authorized_keys
   - Connection still fails with reset

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**

The SSH connection reset errors suggest:
- SSH daemon may be configured to reject certain users or keys
- Possible rate limiting or IP restrictions
- SSH configuration differences between VMs
- The exedev user may not exist or have different permissions on the other VMs

**Next Steps:**
1. Manual SSH testing to identify exact error
2. Check if exedev user exists on other VMs
3. Verify SSH daemon logs on target VMs
4. Alternative: Use SSH keys for forge user if that user exists
5. Consider using Tailscale SSH if available

**Files Modified:**
- `/etc/hosts` - Added marcus-squad DNS entry
- `~/workspace/tools/squad-setup/squad-setup.py` - Changed SQUAD_USER from 'forge' to 'exedev'
- `~/workspace/squad-dashboard/server/services/RealAgentService.ts` - Added SSH config with user/host/port

**Progress Made:**
- ✅ DNS resolution fixed for marcus-squad
- ✅ squad-setup tool updated with correct user
- ✅ RealAgentService.ts updated to use SSH config
- ✅ Server now uses exedev@<vm> format
- ✅ Build successful (npm run build)
- ✅ Server runs and queries all VMs

**Current Status:**
```
Attempting SSH connection to marcus-squad...         (No error = SUCCESS)
Attempting SSH connection to archimedes-squad...     (Permission denied)
Attempting SSH connection to argus-squad...          (Permission denied)
Attempting SSH connection to galen-squad...          (Permission denied)
```

**Dashboard State:**
- marcus-squad: SSH query successful (real data)
- archimedes-squad: Fallback to simulation
- argus-squad: Fallback to simulation
- galen-squad: Fallback to simulation

**Impact:**
- Squad dashboard can now be deployed with 1/4 real agents
- Dashboard will show actual marcus-squad data
- Other three agents use simulation (graceful fallback)
- Server is production-ready for partial deployment

**Files Modified Today:**
- `/etc/hosts` - Added marcus-squad DNS entry
- `~/workspace/tools/squad-setup/squad-setup.py` - Changed SQUAD_USER to 'exedev'
- `~/workspace/squad-dashboard/server/services/RealAgentService.ts` - Added SSH config with user/host/port

**Files Created Today:**

- `memory/2026-02-16-summary.md` - Daily summary (6,877 bytes)
- `learnings/2026-02-16-squad-dashboard-ssh-investigation.md` - Detailed investigation notes (11,533 bytes)

**Commits Made:**
- Update squad-setup to use exedev user
- Add Feb 16 daily summary and investigation notes
- Update MEMORY.md with squad dashboard current status

**Notes:**
- DNS resolution issue completely resolved
- marcus-squad now fully accessible with real SSH
- 3 remaining VMs have SSH key configuration issues
- squad-setup tool ready to complete once SSH is configured
- Server uses correct SSH user (exedev) and hostnames
- RealAgentService.ts is the active service (not AgentService.ts)
- Squad dashboard is partially deployable (1/4 agents accessible)
