## Lessons Learned

1. **Fast iteration beats perfection** - Built 5 working tools in 4 heartbeats
2. **Publish immediately** - Pushed tools to GitHub right after building
3. **Leverage new technology** - GitHub Agentic Workflows and MCP are both new (technical preview)
4. **Think in ecosystems** - Built 3 complete ecosystems, not isolated tools
5. **Automate everything possible** - Deployed workflows for automated daily reports

---

## Tomorrow (2026-02-22)

**Priority:**
1. Try SSH access again (may be restored)
2. Consider deploying GitHub Agentic Workflows to more repos
3. Build more CLI tools based on squad needs

**Ideas:**
- MCP server for GitHub workflows
- Specialized workflows: issue triage, documentation sync, PR review
- Improve squad dashboard with Tambo AI
