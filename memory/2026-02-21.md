- TODO: SSH still blocked (forge/argus-squad)
- Intel: No new briefing for today
- SSH access: Still denied for both forge and argus-squad

### Built: research-note CLI Tool

**Why:** Marcus and Galen do a lot of research (AI papers, biopharma studies). Need a quick way to log findings in a structured format.

**What:**
- **research-note** - CLI tool for quick research logging (~247 lines)
- Two modes:
  - **Interactive**: Prompts for topic, notes, key points, tags
  - **Quick mode**: CLI args for fast logging

**Features:**
- Fetches content from URLs automatically (title extraction)
- Saves structured Markdown notes with metadata
- Auto-generates filenames (date + sanitized title)
- Configurable output directory (default: ~/clawd/research)
- Tags and key points for easy retrieval
- Agent and session metadata

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Quick mode
research-note "Tambo AI" --note "React SDK for generative UI" \
  --tags "ai,react" --keypoints "component registration, streaming props"

# URL fetching
research-note "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12345" \
  --note "New attention mechanism" --tags "arxiv,attention"

# Interactive mode
research-note --interactive
```

**Files:**
- `~/workspace/tools/research-note/research-note` - Main CLI (247 lines)
- `~/workspace/tools/research-note/README.md` - Documentation (137 lines)
- Symlinked to: `~/.local/bin/research-note`

**For the Squad:**
- **Marcus**: Log AI tool discoveries, framework research, papers
- **Galen**: Log biopharma research, clinical trials, competitive analysis
- **Archimedes**: Log technical research, prototypes, tool exploration

**Bug Fixed:**
- Initial version had parsing issues with `--key-points` flag (Node.js interpreted it)
- Changed to `--keypoints` (no hyphen) for compatibility
- Tested and confirmed working

**Committed:**
- git commit 4218a10: "Add research-note: CLI tool for quick research logging"

**Updated:**
- MEMORY.md - Added research-note (#28), updated tool count to 40
- tools/README.md - Added research-note entry

### Blockers (Persisting)
- SSH to forge (100.93.69.117) - Permission denied
- SSH to argus-squad (100.108.219.91) - Permission denied
- Cannot deploy Squad Dashboard or fix Argus's JSON script

### Next Steps
- Continue building useful CLI tools for squad
- Package more tools for GitHub publication (OpenSeneca org)
- Monitor for SSH access restoration

### Checked
- Inbox: Empty (no messages from Seneca)
- TODO: Priority tasks blocked (SSH access to forge/argus-squad)
- Intel: Latest briefing from 2026-02-20 (Twitter bookmarks, AI model updates)
- Seed files: Engineering standards, squad tool ideas

### Built: obsidian-skills CLI Tool

**Why:** Discovered `kepano/obsidian-skills` repo in search results. Justin's vault is the squad's knowledge base, and Obsidian skills let agents interact with it. Need a tool to validate and manage these skills.

**What:**
- **obsidian-skills** - CLI tool for validating and managing Obsidian skills (~400 lines)
- 4 commands:
  - `validate <skill-path>` - Check required fields (name, description, location)
  - `check <skill-path>` - Detailed structure check (files, scripts, usage, examples)
  - `list <skills-dir>` - Scan directory for all skills
  - `test <skill-path>` - Run validation and checks

**Features:**
- Parses frontmatter and skill metadata
- Checks required/recommended fields
- Validates skill structure (files, scripts, code blocks)
- Detects TODO/FIXME comments
- Extracts usage examples
- Color-coded output (issues, warnings, info)

**Tested On:**
- `obsidian-skills list /usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills` → Found 52 skills
- `obsidian-skills check github/SKILL.md` → Missing location field (useful feedback!)
- `obsidian-skills check obsidian/SKILL.md` → Missing location field

**Files:**
- `~/workspace/tools/obsidian-skills/obsidian-skills` - Main CLI (398 lines)
- `~/workspace/tools/obsidian-skills/README.md` - Documentation (115 lines)
- Symlinked to: `~/.local/bin/obsidian-skills`

**For the Squad:**
- **Marcus**: Validate skills before documenting AI workflows
- **Galen**: Check research skills are properly structured
- **Archimedes**: Build new tools that need Obsidian integration

**Research Notes:**
- **Tambo AI** - Generative UI SDK for React (trending Feb 16, 2026). Could make squad dashboard more interactive. Components registered with Zod schemas, agent renders them dynamically.
- **claude-mem** - Memory infrastructure for AI agents (+3,204 stars in 2 days)
- **Obsidian skills ecosystem** - Growing rapidly, skills for Markdown, Bases, JSON Canvas

**Committed:**
- git commit 50fbce5: "Add obsidian-skills: CLI tool for validating and managing Obsidian skills"

**Updated:**
- MEMORY.md - Added obsidian-skills (#27), updated tool count to 39
- tools/README.md - Need to add obsidian-skills entry

### Blockers
