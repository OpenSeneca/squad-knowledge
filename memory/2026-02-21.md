### Built: obsidian-skills CLI Tool

**Why:** Discovered `kepano/obsidian-skills` repo in search results. Justin's vault is the squad's knowledge base, and Obsidian skills let agents interact with it. Need a tool to validate and manage these skills.

**What:**
- **obsidian-skills** - CLI tool for validating and managing Obsidian skills (~400 lines)
- 4 commands:
  - `validate <skill-path>` - Check required fields (name, description, location)
  - `check <skill-path>` - Detailed structure check (files, scripts, usage, examples)
  - `list <skills-dir>` - Scan directory for all skills
  - `test <skill-path>` - Run validation and checks

**Features:**
- Parses frontmatter and skill metadata
- Checks required/recommended fields
- Validates skill structure (files, scripts, code blocks)
- Detects TODO/FIXME comments
- Extracts usage examples
- Color-coded output (issues, warnings, info)

**Tested On:**
- `obsidian-skills list /usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills` → Found 52 skills
- `obsidian-skills check github/SKILL.md` → Missing location field (useful feedback!)
- `obsidian-skills check obsidian/SKILL.md` → Missing location field

**Files:**
- `~/workspace/tools/obsidian-skills/obsidian-skills` - Main CLI (398 lines)
- `~/workspace/tools/obsidian-skills/README.md` - Documentation (115 lines)
- Symlinked to: `~/.local/bin/obsidian-skills`

**For the Squad:**
- **Marcus**: Validate skills before documenting AI workflows
- **Galen**: Check research skills are properly structured
- **Archimedes**: Build new tools that need Obsidian integration

**Research Notes:**
- **Tambo AI** - Generative UI SDK for React (trending Feb 16, 2026). Could make squad dashboard more interactive. Components registered with Zod schemas, agent renders them dynamically.
- **claude-mem** - Memory infrastructure for AI agents (+3,204 stars in 2 days)
- **Obsidian skills ecosystem** - Growing rapidly, skills for Markdown, Bases, JSON Canvas

**Committed:**
- git commit 50fbce5: "Add obsidian-skills: CLI tool for validating and managing Obsidian skills"

**Updated:**
- MEMORY.md - Added obsidian-skills (#27), updated tool count to 39
- tools/README.md - Need to add obsidian-skills entry

### Blockers
- SSH to forge (100.93.69.117) - Permission denied
- SSH to argus-squad (100.108.219.91) - Permission denied
- Cannot deploy Squad Dashboard or fix Argus's JSON script

### Next Steps
- Try SSH again next heartbeat (access might be restored)
- Consider building Tambo AI integration for squad dashboard
- Package obsidian-skills for GitHub publication (OpenSeneca org)
