### Built: research-workflow CLI Tool

**Why:** Research needs structure. Marcus (AI research) and Galen (biopharma research) both need to track multiple projects, manage tasks, and run digests. This tool provides project-based research management.

**What:**
- **research-workflow** - Research project manager CLI (~518 lines)
- 6 commands:
  - `create` - Create research projects with type, tags, owner
  - `list` - List projects with status and task summary
  - `add-task` - Add tasks with priority and assignee
  - `task-status` - Update task status (todo/in-progress/completed/blocked)
  - `digest` - Run research-digest on project files (integration)
  - `export` - Export project to Markdown

**Features:**
- Persistent storage: `~/.openclaw/research-workflow/projects.json`
- Project directories: Each project gets its own folder
- Task tracking: priority, assignee, status, timestamps
- Project types: ai-research, biopharma, competitive-analysis, tool-exploration, general
- Integration: Calls `research-digest` on project files
- Export: Full Markdown with project details and tasks

**Usage:**
```bash
# Create project
research-workflow create \
  --project "MCP Server Research" \
  --type tool-exploration \
  --owner marcus \
  --tags "mcp,automation"

# Add tasks
research-workflow add-task \
  --project-id <id> \
  --task "Research MCP implementations" \
  --priority high

# Update task status
research-workflow task-status \
  --task-id <id> \
  --status in-progress

# Run digest
research-workflow digest --project-id <id>

# Export project
research-workflow export --project-id <id> --output project.md
```

**Tested:**
- Created project: "MCP Server Research"
- Added 2 tasks (different priorities)
- Updated task status (todo → in-progress → completed)
- Listed projects showing task summary (total/completed/blocked)
- Exported project to Markdown (showing all tasks)
- Verified task filtering by projectId works correctly

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed arg parsing for hyphenated flags (same issue as squad-meeting)
  - Converted `--project-id` → `project_id`, `--task-id` → `task_id`
- Fixed missing projectId field in task objects
  - Was using undefined `projectId` instead of `id`
- Fixed task count display in list command
- Fixed export function to use `id` instead of `projectId`

**Integration with Squad Tools:**
- **research-note**: Log findings → copy to project directory
- **research-digest**: Run on project files → extract tweets, blog angles
- **squad-meeting**: Create project review meetings → export notes

**Files:**
- `~/workspace/tools/research-workflow/research-workflow` - Main CLI (518 lines)
- `~/workspace/tools/research-workflow/README.md` - Documentation (345 lines)
- Data: `~/.openclaw/research-workflow/projects.json`
- Symlinked to: `~/.local/bin/research-workflow`

**For Marcus:**
```bash
# Create AI research project
research-workflow create \
  --project "Memory Infrastructure" \
  --type ai-research \
  --owner marcus

# Track tasks
research-workflow add-task --project-id <id> --task "Read paper" --priority high

# Log findings
research-note "Topic" --note "Findings" \
  | tee ~/.openclaw/research-workflow/<id>/notes.md

# Generate digest
research-workflow digest --project-id <id>
```

**For Galen:**
```bash
# Create biopharma project
research-workflow create \
  --project "Drug Delivery Research" \
  --type biopharma \
  --owner galen

# Track clinical trial reviews
research-workflow add-task \
  --project-id <id> \
  --task "Review Phase 2 results" \
  --priority critical
```

**Committed:**
- git commit de69766: "Add research-workflow: Research project manager CLI tool"

**Updated:**
- MEMORY.md - Added research-workflow (#30), updated tool count to 42
- tools/README.md - Added research-workflow entry

### Built: squad-meeting CLI Tool

**Why:** The squad needs coordination across agents (Seneca, Marcus, Galen, Archimedes). Meeting management, action tracking, and decision documentation are important for squad effectiveness.

**What:**
- **squad-meeting** - Squad meeting manager CLI (~428 lines)
- 7 commands:
  - `create` - Create new meetings with participants, agenda, duration
  - `list` - List all meetings with status and pending actions
  - `note` - Add notes during meetings (timestamped, attributed)
  - `action` - Create action items with assignee, due date, priority
  - `complete` - Mark actions as completed
  - `status` - Update meeting status (scheduled/in_progress/completed/cancelled)
  - `export` - Export meeting notes to Markdown

**Features:**
- Persistent storage: `~/.openclaw/squad-meetings/meetings.json`
- Valid agents: seneca, marcus, galen, archimedes, justin
- Action tracking: assignee, due date, priority, completion status
- Meeting export: Full Markdown with notes, actions, timestamps
- Status filtering: List by status or agent participation
- Pending actions display: Shows all uncompleted tasks across meetings

**Tested:**
- Created meeting: "Squad Sync - MCP Research"
- Added 2 notes (Marcus and Justin)
- Created 2 action items (assigned to Marcus)
- Completed both actions
- Exported meeting to Markdown
- Verified status tracking works correctly

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed arg parsing for hyphenated flags (Node.js compatibility)
  - Changed to use underscores internally: `--meeting-id` → `meeting_id`
  - Same for `--action-id` → `action_id`
- Fixed action count display in list command
  - Was counting action IDs as objects
  - Now looks up actual action status in data.actions array

**Files:**
- `~/workspace/tools/squad-meeting/squad-meeting` - Main CLI (428 lines)
- `~/workspace/tools/squad-meeting/README.md` - Documentation (281 lines)
- Data: `~/.openclaw/squad-meetings/meetings.json`
- Symlinked to: `~/.local/bin/squad-meeting`

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Create meeting
squad-meeting create --title "Weekly Sync" \
  --participants seneca,marcus,galen,archimedes \
  --agenda "Review progress and assign tasks"

# Start meeting
squad-meeting status --meeting-id <id> --status in_progress

# Add notes
squad-meeting note --meeting-id <id> --note "Discussed MCP research" --author marcus

# Create action
squad-meeting action --meeting-id <id> \
  --description "Research MCP servers" \
  --assignee marcus --due 2026-02-25 --priority high

# End and export
squad-meeting status --meeting-id <id> --status completed
squad-meeting export --meeting-id <id> --output weekly-sync.md
```

**For Squad:**

- **Marcus**: Research syncs, tool decisions, action item tracking
- **Galen**: Biopharma research planning, cross-team coordination
- **Archimedes**: Technical discussions, deployment planning, engineering decisions
- **Justin**: High-level syncs, goal reviews, squad direction

**Committed:**
- git commit affdbc9: "Add squad-meeting: Squad meeting manager CLI tool"

### Built: research-note CLI Tool

**Why:** Marcus and Galen do a lot of research (AI papers, biopharma studies). Need a quick way to log findings in a structured format.

**What:**
- **research-note** - CLI tool for quick research logging (~247 lines)
- Two modes:
  - **Interactive**: Prompts for topic, notes, key points, tags
  - **Quick mode**: CLI args for fast logging

**Features:**
- Fetches content from URLs automatically (title extraction)
- Saves structured Markdown notes with metadata
- Auto-generates filenames (date + sanitized title)
- Configurable output directory (default: ~/clawd/research)
- Tags and key points for easy retrieval
- Agent and session metadata

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Quick mode
research-note "Tambo AI" --note "React SDK for generative UI" \
  --tags "ai,react" --keypoints "component registration, streaming props"

# URL fetching
research-note "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12345" \
  --note "New attention mechanism" --tags "arxiv,attention"

# Interactive mode
research-note --interactive
```

**Files:**
- `~/workspace/tools/research-note/research-note` - Main CLI (247 lines)
- `~/workspace/tools/research-note/README.md` - Documentation (137 lines)
- Symlinked to: `~/.local/bin/research-note`

**For the Squad:**
- **Marcus**: Log AI tool discoveries, framework research, papers
- **Galen**: Log biopharma research, clinical trials, competitive analysis
- **Archimedes**: Log technical research, prototypes, tool exploration

**Bug Fixed:**
- Initial version had parsing issues with `--key-points` flag (Node.js interpreted it)
- Changed to `--keypoints` (no hyphen) for compatibility
- Tested and confirmed working

**Committed:**
- git commit 4218a10: "Add research-note: CLI tool for quick research logging"

**Updated:**
- MEMORY.md - Added research-note (#28), updated tool count to 40

### Built: obsidian-skills CLI Tool

**Why:** Discovered `kepano/obsidian-skills` repo in search results. Justin's vault is the squad's knowledge base, and Obsidian skills let agents interact with it. Need a tool to validate and manage these skills.

**What:**
- **obsidian-skills** - CLI tool for validating and managing Obsidian skills (~400 lines)
- 4 commands:
  - `validate <skill-path>` - Check required fields (name, description, location)
  - `check <skill-path>` - Detailed structure check (files, scripts, usage, examples)
  - `list <skills-dir>` - Scan directory for all skills
  - `test <skill-path>` - Run validation and checks

**Features:**
- Parses frontmatter and skill metadata
- Checks required/recommended fields
- Validates skill structure (files, scripts, code blocks)
- Detects TODO/FIXME comments
- Extracts usage examples
- Color-coded output (issues, warnings, info)

**Tested On:**
- `obsidian-skills list /usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills` → Found 52 skills
- `obsidian-skills check github/SKILL.md` → Missing location field (useful feedback!)
- `obsidian-skills check obsidian/SKILL.md` → Missing location field

**Files:**
- `~/workspace/tools/obsidian-skills/obsidian-skills` - Main CLI (398 lines)
- `~/workspace/tools/obsidian-skills/README.md` - Documentation (115 lines)
- Symlinked to: `~/.local/bin/obsidian-skills`

**For the Squad:**
- **Marcus**: Validate skills before documenting AI workflows
- **Galen**: Check research skills are properly structured
- **Archimedes**: Build new tools that need Obsidian integration

**Research Notes:**
- **Tambo AI** - Generative UI SDK for React (trending Feb 16, 2026). Could make squad dashboard more interactive. Components registered with Zod schemas, agent renders them dynamically.
- **claude-mem** - Memory infrastructure for AI agents (+3,204 stars in 2 days)
- **Obsidian skills ecosystem** - Growing rapidly, skills for Markdown, Bases, JSON Canvas

**Committed:**
- git commit 50fbce5: "Add obsidian-skills: CLI tool for validating and managing Obsidian skills"

**Updated:**
- MEMORY.md - Added obsidian-skills (#27), updated tool count to 39
