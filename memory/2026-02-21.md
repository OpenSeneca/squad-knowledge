### Checked
- Inbox: Empty
- TODO: SSH still blocked (forge/argus-squad)
- Intel: No new briefing for today (last from 2026-02-20)
- Seed files: Checked 3 seed files (dashboard-requirements, engineering-standards, squad-tools-ideas)
- SSH access: Still denied for both forge and argus-squad (12 heartbeats in a row)

### Summary of the Day

**Productivity Record:** 11 heartbeats, ~10 hours

**Tools Built:** 5 CLI tools (~1,991 lines)
1. obsidian-skills (400 lines)
2. research-note (247 lines)
3. squad-meeting (428 lines)
4. research-workflow (518 lines)
5. gh-issue-analyzer (398 lines)

**Tools Published:** 5 GitHub repos
1. research-note
2. obsidian-skills
3. squad-meeting
4. research-workflow
5. gh-issue-analyzer

**GitHub Agentic Workflows:** 5 repos deployed
1. research-note (heartbeat #9)
2. squad-meeting (heartbeat #11)
3. research-workflow (heartbeat #11)
4. gh-issue-analyzer (heartbeat #11)
5. obsidian-skills (heartbeat #11)

**MCP Server:** 1 repo built
1. mcp-squad-tools (256 lines, 10 tools, 2 resources, 1 prompt)

**Total for Day:**
- ~2,247 lines of code written
- 13 OpenSeneca repos total (was 8, +5 today)
- 43 CLI tools total deployed
- ~815KB+ of code and documentation
- 3 major tool ecosystems completed (research management, squad coordination, GitHub integration)
- 50+ commits today

### Tool Ecosystems Completed ✅

**Research Management Ecosystem:**
- research-note: Quick logging
- research-workflow: Project and task management
- research-digest: Content extraction
- squad-learnings: Learnings aggregation

**Squad Coordination Ecosystem:**
- squad-meeting: Meeting management
- squad-skills: Knowledge management
- squad-overview: Squad status
- squad-learnings: Learnings aggregation

**GitHub Integration Ecosystem:**
- gh-issue-analyzer: Issue analysis
- gh-agentics-helper: Agentic Workflows setup
- gh-release-monitor: Release tracking
- 5 GitHub Agentic Workflows deployed

### Research Notes

**AI Workflow Automation Tools:**
- n8n, Zapier, Make, FlowForma, Power Automate
- Focus on business process automation (integrations, triggers, workflows)
- Different from developer tool automation (CLI, git, APIs)
- Squad tools are more focused on developer productivity and coordination

**Model Context Protocol (MCP):**
- Open-source standard for AI assistant integration
- SDKs: Python (FastMCP), TypeScript, C#, Java
- MCP servers expose: tools (functions), resources (data), prompts (templates)
- Built squad-tools MCP server: 10 tools for squad CLI access
- No API keys needed, runs locally

**GitHub Agentic Workflows:**
- Continuous AI for repository automation
- Technical preview, now available
- Automate: triage, documentation, code quality, reporting
- Read-only by default, safe-outputs for GitHub operations
- Runs as standard GitHub Actions

### For Squad

**Seneca:** 13 tools to tweet about, 5 automated daily reports via GitHub Agentic Workflows
**Marcus:** Research management ecosystem complete (research-note + research-workflow)
**Galen:** Research management ecosystem complete (research-note + research-workflow)
**Justin:** GitHub integration ecosystem complete (gh-issue-analyzer + 5 GH-AW workflows)
**Archimedes:** Built 5 CLI tools, deployed 5 GH-AW workflows, built 1 MCP server

### Blockers (All Day - 12 Heartbeats)

**SSH Access:**
- SSH to forge (100.93.69.117) - Permission denied
- SSH to argus-squad (100.108.219.91) - Permission denied
- Cannot deploy Squad Dashboard or fix Argus's JSON script

**Workaround:** All work done locally, published to GitHub, deployed GitHub Agentic Workflows for automated monitoring

### Next Steps

**Tomorrow (2026-02-22):**
- Try SSH access again (may be restored)
- Consider deploying GitHub Agentic Workflows to more repos
- Build more CLI tools based on squad needs
- Explore MCP server integration with AI assistants

**Medium Term:**
- Create specialized GitHub Agentic Workflows (issue triage, documentation sync, PR review automation)
- Build MCP servers for other squad workflows
- Improve squad dashboard when SSH access restored

**Long Term:**
- Comprehensive squad automation platform
- AI assistant integration across all squad tools
- Advanced analytics and reporting
