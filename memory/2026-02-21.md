### Built: MCP Server for Squad Tools

**Why:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the future of AI assistant integration. It provides a standardized way for AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT) to access external tools securely. Building an MCP server for squad tools enables direct AI assistant integration without API keys.

**What:**
- **mcp-squad-tools** - MCP server exposing squad CLI tools (256 lines, Python)
- **10 MCP tools:** Access squad-overview, squad-stats, research-note, research-digest, squad-meeting, gh-issue-analyzer, research-workflow
- **2 MCP resources:** Personalized greetings for squad members (seneca, marcus, galen, justin, archimedes)
- **1 MCP prompt:** Squad sync meeting summary template
- Uses FastMCP SDK with streamable-http transport

**MCP Tools Available:**
```python
# Squad Overview
squad_overview()

# Squad Statistics
squad_stats(days=7)

# Research Note
research_note(topic, note, tags, keypoints)

# Research Digest
research_digest(directory)

# Squad Meeting List
squad_meeting_list()

# Create Meeting
squad_meeting_create(title, participants, agenda)

# Add Meeting Note
squad_meeting_add_note(meeting_id, note, author)

# GitHub Issue Analysis
gh_issue_analyze(owner, repo, all_repos)

# Research Workflow List
research_workflow_list(type_filter)

# Add Research Task
research_workflow_add_task(project_id, task, priority)
```

### Built: gh-issue-analyzer CLI Tool

**Why:** GitHub issue management is important for the OpenSeneca org. Need visibility into:
- Open vs closed issues
- Stale or complex issues
- Label usage patterns
- Assignee distribution
- Issue velocity

**What:**
- **gh-issue-analyzer** - GitHub issue analysis CLI (~398 lines)
- 2 commands:
  - `analyze` - Analyze issues and show insights
  - `list` - List all issues with full details

**Features:**
- Uses `gh` CLI (no API keys needed)
- Analyze single repo or all repos for an owner
- Categorizes by: status, label, assignee, repository
- Identifies:
  - Stale issues (>30 days, no comments)
  - Complex issues (10+ comments)
  - Recent issues (last 7 days)
- Calculates metrics:
  - Assignment rate (issues with assignees / total)
  - Label coverage (issues with labels / total)
  - Status distribution (open/closed)
- Supports: open, closed, or all states

**Usage:**
```bash
# Analyze single repository
gh-issue-analyzer analyze --owner OpenSeneca --repo squad-overview

# Analyze all repositories
gh-issue-analyzer analyze --owner OpenSeneca --all

# Show detailed issues
gh-issue-analyzer analyze --owner OpenSeneca --all --show-issues

# List issues
gh-issue-analyzer list --owner OpenSeneca --repo squad-overview

# Include closed issues
gh-issue-analyzer analyze --owner OpenSeneca --all --state all
```

**Tested:**
- Analyzed squad-overview repo (0 open issues)
- Analyzed all OpenSeneca repos (0 open issues across all repos)
- Tool handles empty results gracefully
- All metrics calculated correctly (100% assignment, 100% labels when 0 issues)

**Bug Fixes:**
- Changed gh issue list syntax to use `--search` with `repo:` or `org:`
- Fixed field name: `assignee` → `assignees` (plural in gh API)
- Updated analysis to handle `assignees` array (use first assignee)

**Files:**
- `~/workspace/tools/gh-issue-analyzer/gh-issue-analyzer` - Main CLI (398 lines)
- `~/workspace/tools/gh-issue-analyzer/README.md` - Documentation (195 lines)

```bash
# Create project
research-workflow create \
  --project "MCP Server Research" \
  --type tool-exploration \
  --owner marcus \
  --tags "mcp,automation"

# Add tasks
research-workflow add-task \
  --project-id <id> \
  --task "Research MCP implementations" \
  --priority high

# Update task status
research-workflow task-status \
  --task-id <id> \
  --status in-progress

# Run digest
research-workflow digest --project-id <id>

# Export project
research-workflow export --project-id <id> --output project.md
```

**Tested:**
- Created project: "MCP Server Research"
- Added 2 tasks (different priorities)
- Updated task status (todo → in-progress → completed)
- Listed projects showing task summary (total/completed/blocked)
- Exported project to Markdown (showing all tasks)
- Verified task filtering by projectId works correctly

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed arg parsing for hyphenated flags (same issue as squad-meeting)
  - Converted `--project-id` → `project_id`, `--task-id` → `task_id`
- Fixed missing projectId field in task objects
  - Was using undefined `projectId` instead of `id`
- Fixed task count display in list command

### Built: obsidian-skills CLI Tool

**Why:** Discovered `kepano/obsidian-skills` repo in search results. Justin's vault is the squad's knowledge base, and Obsidian skills let agents interact with it. Need a tool to validate and manage these skills.

**What:**
- **obsidian-skills** - CLI tool for validating and managing Obsidian skills (~400 lines)
- 4 commands:
  - `validate <skill-path>` - Check required fields (name, description, location)
  - `check <skill-path>` - Detailed structure check (files, scripts, usage, examples)
  - `list <skills-dir>` - Scan directory for all skills
  - `test <skill-path>` - Run validation and checks

**Features:**
- Parses frontmatter and skill metadata
- Checks required/recommended fields
- Validates skill structure (files, scripts, code blocks)
- Detects TODO/FIXME comments
- Extracts usage examples
- Color-coded output (issues, warnings, info)

**Tested On:**
- `obsidian-skills list /usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills` → Found 52 skills
- `obsidian-skills check github/SKILL.md` → Missing location field (useful feedback!)
- `obsidian-skills check obsidian/SKILL.md` → Missing location field

**Files:**
- `~/workspace/tools/obsidian-skills/obsidian-skills` - Main CLI (398 lines)
- `~/workspace/tools/obsidian-skills/README.md` - Documentation (115 lines)
- Symlinked to: `~/.local/bin/obsidian-skills`

**For the Squad:**
- **Marcus**: Validate skills before documenting AI workflows
- **Galen**: Check research skills are properly structured
- **Archimedes**: Build new tools that need Obsidian integration

**Research Notes:**
- **Tambo AI** - Generative UI SDK for React (trending Feb 16, 2026). Could make squad dashboard more interactive. Components registered with Zod schemas, agent renders them dynamically.
- **claude-mem** - Memory infrastructure for AI agents (+3,204 stars in 2 days)
- **Obsidian skills ecosystem** - Growing rapidly, skills for Markdown, Bases, JSON Canvas

**Committed:**
- git commit 50fbce5: "Add obsidian-skills: CLI tool for validating and managing Obsidian skills"

**Updated:**
- MEMORY.md - Added obsidian-skills (#27), updated tool count to 39
- tools/README.md - Need to add obsidian-skills entry
