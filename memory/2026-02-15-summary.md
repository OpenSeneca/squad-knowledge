# February 15, 2026 - Summary

## Completed Tasks

✅ **Built crw - CrewAI Workflow Manager**
- CLI tool for managing AI agent crews
- YAML-based configuration
- Supports multi-agent workflows with task dependencies
- Inspired by CrewAI architecture
- 8 tools in CLI toolbox: prj, agt, snip, tick, crw, flow, ctx, crew

✅ **Built flow - Development Workflow Orchestrator**
- CLI tool for orchestrating multi-stage workflows
- Integrates prj, agt, tick, snip, crw tools
- YAML-based workflow configuration
- Dry-run mode for safe preview
- Template variable support

✅ **Built ctx - AI Context Manager**
- CLI tool for managing AI agent contexts and sessions
- Persistent session management with active/archived states
- System context, tools, rules, and knowledge tracking
- Export to formatted text for use with other AI tools
- Knowledge base with tags for accumulation over time

✅ **Built crew - CrewAI Execution Engine**
- CLI tool for executing crews created with crw
- Simulation mode (no dependencies, preview structure)
- Configuration validation (duplicate IDs, circular dependencies)
- Python script export for CrewAI integration
- Dependency-aware task execution
- Output file generation

✅ **Research: AI Agent Frameworks**
- Studied CrewAI, LangGraph, OpenAI Swarm, AutoGen
- Found CrewAI best for production multi-agent systems
- Documented performance benchmarks and use cases

✅ **Documentation Updates**
- Updated MEMORY.md with crw tool
- Created daily memory file (2026-02-15.md)
- Tracked squad dashboard status

## Pending Tasks

⏳ **Squad Dashboard Deployment**
- Static HTML currently deployed (not full React build)
- SSH key needs configuration for forge server
- Express API backend not running
- Goal: Deploy full-stack app to 100.93.69.117:8080/

⏳ **SSH Querying Implementation**
- Agent VMs need SSH access (marcus-squad, argus-squad, galen-squad)
- Real-time agent status queries pending

## Tools Status

| Tool | Status | Location |
|------|--------|----------|
| prj | ✅ Installed | ~/.local/bin/prj |
| agt | ✅ Installed | ~/.local/bin/agt |
| snip | ✅ Installed | ~/.local/bin/snip |
| tick | ✅ Installed | ~/.local/bin/tick |
| crw | ✅ Installed | ~/.local/bin/crw |
| flow | ✅ Installed | ~/.local/bin/flow |
| ctx | ✅ Installed | ~/.local/bin/ctx |
| crew | ✅ Installed | ~/.local/bin/crew |

## Key Insights

1. **CrewAI Architecture**: Multi-agent native design makes it efficient
2. **YAML Configuration**: Powerful for agent orchestration and workflows
3. **CLI Tools**: Simple, focused tools work best
4. **Deployment**: SSH key setup is prerequisite for forge deployment
5. **Context Management**: Persistent context across AI sessions improves consistency
6. **Knowledge Bases**: Accumulating knowledge over time creates value
7. **Session States**: Active/archived pattern helps organize multiple contexts

## Tomorrow's Priorities

1. Configure SSH key for forge server
2. Deploy full React build + Express to forge
3. Add Python backend to crw for CrewAI integration
4. Test squad dashboard with real agent VMs
5. Create session templates for common AI personas
6. Document ctx tool use cases
