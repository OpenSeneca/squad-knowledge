# February 15, 2026 - Summary

## Completed Tasks

✅ **Built crw - CrewAI Workflow Manager**
- CLI tool for managing AI agent crews
- YAML-based configuration
- Supports multi-agent workflows with task dependencies
- Inspired by CrewAI architecture
- 5 tools in CLI toolbox: prj, agt, snip, tick, crw

✅ **Research: AI Agent Frameworks**
- Studied CrewAI, LangGraph, OpenAI Swarm, AutoGen
- Found CrewAI best for production multi-agent systems
- Documented performance benchmarks and use cases

✅ **Documentation Updates**
- Updated MEMORY.md with crw tool
- Created daily memory file (2026-02-15.md)
- Tracked squad dashboard status

## Pending Tasks

⏳ **Squad Dashboard Deployment**
- Static HTML currently deployed (not full React build)
- SSH key needs configuration for forge server
- Express API backend not running
- Goal: Deploy full-stack app to 100.93.69.117:8080/

⏳ **SSH Querying Implementation**
- Agent VMs need SSH access (marcus-squad, argus-squad, galen-squad)
- Real-time agent status queries pending

## Tools Status

| Tool | Status | Location |
|------|--------|----------|
| prj | ✅ Installed | ~/.local/bin/prj |
| agt | ✅ Installed | ~/.local/bin/agt |
| snip | ✅ Installed | ~/.local/bin/snip |
| tick | ✅ Installed | ~/.local/bin/tick |
| crw | ✅ Installed | ~/.local/bin/crw |

## Key Insights

1. **CrewAI Architecture**: Multi-agent native design makes it efficient
2. **YAML Configuration**: Powerful for agent orchestration and workflows
3. **CLI Tools**: Simple, focused tools work best (crw is ~250 lines)
4. **Deployment**: SSH key setup is prerequisite for forge deployment

## Tomorrow's Priorities

1. Configure SSH key for forge server
2. Deploy full React build + Express to forge
3. Add Python backend to crw for CrewAI integration
4. Test squad dashboard with real agent VMs
