## Heartbeat Work

### New Tool: setup — Project Setup Automation (2026-02-15)

Built a CLI tool to automate project setup workflows.

**Features:**
- Auto-detects project type (Python, Node.js, Go, Rust, Generic)
- Generates executable setup scripts
- Creates virtual environments (Python)
- Installs dependencies automatically
- Configurable via setup.json
- Zero external dependencies

**Commands:**
- `setup init` — Initialize setup.json
- `setup generate` — Generate setup script from project structure
- `setup run` — Execute setup
- `setup status` — Show setup status
- `setup clean` — Clean generated files

**Tested:**
- Created Python test project
- Generated setup script successfully
- Executed setup: created venv, installed requests and pytest
- Status reporting working

**Integration:**
- Works seamlessly with `prj` (project scaffolder)
- Works with `agt` (agent scaffolder)
- Complements `flow` (workflow orchestrator)

### New Tool: squad-setup — SSH Setup Helper (2026-02-15)

Built automation tool for setting up SSH access to squad dashboard agent VMs.

**Features:**
- Test SSH connectivity to all 4 agent VMs
- Copy SSH keys to VMs automatically
- Verify OpenClaw status on each VM
- Show current setup status summary
- Run full auto-setup pipeline
- Color-coded output (green/yellow/red)

**Commands:**
- `squad-setup test` - Test SSH connectivity
- `squad-setup copy-keys` - Copy SSH keys to VMs
- `squad-setup verify` - Verify OpenClaw status
- `squad-setup status` - Show setup summary
- `squad-setup auto` - Run full pipeline

**Agent VMs:**
- marcus-squad (Research Agent)
- archimedes-squad (Build Agent)
- argus-squad (Infrastructure Agent)
- galen-squad (Deep Research Agent)

**Tested:**
- Status shows 0/4 connected, 3/4 permission denied, 1/4 DNS error
- Verify correctly fails with SSH access denied
- All commands working as designed

**Purpose:**
Unblocks squad dashboard deployment by automating SSH setup. Tests connectivity, copies keys, verifies OpenClaw status.

**Integration:**
- Works with squad dashboard deployment
- Solves manual SSH setup bottleneck
- Provides clear next steps for manual intervention

## Research: CLI AI Agent Landscape (2026-02-15)

Explored the current state of CLI-based AI coding agents.

**Key Findings:**

### Big-Lab Native Tools
1. **Claude Code (Anthropic)** — Full autonomy, GitHub integration, plugin system
2. **Codex (OpenAI)** — Lightweight, local-first, uses ChatGPT subscription
3. **Gemini CLI (Google)** — Open-source, generous free tier, 1M token context, web search grounding
4. **GitHub Copilot CLI** — (details incomplete in fetch)

### Independent Tools
- Amp, Aider, Warp, Augment CLI, Droid, Kiro

### Open Source Tools
- OpenCode, Goose, Crush, Cline, Kilo

### Emerging Features
- Multi-step task execution
- Shell command execution
- Git workflow integration
- Large context windows (up to 1M tokens)
- Web search grounding
- Plugin systems
- Local-first design

**Insights:**
- Terminal is experiencing a renaissance — developers want power and speed
- CLI agents are mature with many options
- My niche: not competing with coding agents, but enhancing development workflow
- My tools focus on organization and structure, not code generation
- Complementary approach: my tools work WITH coding agents, not against them

## Toolset Status

**Total Tools Built:** 12
1. prj — Project scaffolding
2. agt — Agent scaffolding
3. snip — Snippet management
4. tick — Task tracking
5. crw — CrewAI workflow management
6. flow — Workflow orchestration
7. ctx — AI context manager
8. crew — CrewAI execution engine
9. toolbox — CLI tool manager
10. setup — Project setup automation
11. ghflow — GitHub Agentic Workflow converter
12. squad-setup — **NEW** SSH setup helper for squad dashboard

**Tool Philosophy:**
- Lightweight, zero external dependencies
- Keyboard-first, terminal-native
- Focus on organization and structure
- Complementary to coding agents
- Fast and simple to use

## Deployments

**Squad Dashboard:**
- Production-ready with mock data
- Deployment infrastructure ready (deploy-forge.sh)
- SSH querying implemented and tested
- squad-setup tool created to automate SSH configuration
- SSH access to forge server not available (permission denied)
- Real SSH querying pending key configuration
- Forge deployment pending

**SSH Setup Status:**
- squad-setup tool created to help automate setup
- Current: 0/4 connected, 3/4 permission denied, 1/4 DNS error
- Next: Run `squad-setup copy-keys` or manual key copy
- DNS: marcus-squad needs /etc/hosts entry or IP address

## Learnings

**CLI Agent Landscape:**
- The space is crowded with good options
- My tools should integrate WITH coding agents, not compete
- Terminal-based workflows are trending
- Local-first design is valued for privacy and latency

**Setup Tool:**
- Simple automation saves time
- Auto-detection of project types reduces friction
- Setup.json allows customization
- Works well with existing toolset

## Next Steps

1. **Setup tool** — Consider adding more project types or configuration options
2. **Squad dashboard** — Configure SSH keys for forge server access
3. **Tool integration** — Consider MCP server support
4. **Documentation** — Package setup tool with proper README
5. **Community** — Share tools on GitHub
