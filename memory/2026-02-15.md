### Squad Dashboard Status

**Current State:**
- Full-stack dashboard running at http://100.93.69.117:8080/
- Backend API endpoints return 404 (Node.js not running, only static HTML)
- SSH connection to forge server not configured (Permission denied)

**Issues Identified:**
- Static HTML file deployed instead of full React build
- Express API server not running on forge
- SSH key needs setup for forge deployment

### Built: crw - CrewAI Workflow Manager

**Created:** CLI tool for managing AI agent crews with YAML configuration

**Location:** `~/workspace/tools/crw/`

**Features:**
- `crw init` - Initialize ~/.crew/ directory
- `crw create <name>` - Create new crew with crew.yaml template
- `crw list` - List all crews
- `crw show <name>` - Show crew details and config
- `crw run <name>` - Execute crew workflow
- `crw delete <name>` - Delete crew

**Inspired by CrewAI:**
- YAML-based agent definitions (role, goal, backstory)
- Task definitions with dependencies
- Sequential/hierarchical execution modes
- Ready for Python/CrewAI integration

**Tested:**
- Created research-writers crew successfully
- Verified crew.yaml structure
- All commands working

### Built: flow - Development Workflow Orchestrator

**Created:** CLI tool for orchestrating multi-stage development workflows

**Location:** `~/workspace/tools/flow/`

**Features:**
- `flow init` - Initialize ~/.flow/ directory
- `flow create <name>` - Create workflow with stages
- `flow list` - List all workflows
- `flow show <name>` - Show workflow configuration
- `flow run <name>` - Execute workflow
- `flow run <name> --dry-run` - Preview without executing

**Orchestrates:**
- prj (project scaffolding)
- agt (agent scaffolding)
- tick (task tracking)
- snip (snippet management)
- crw (crew orchestration)

**Workflow Structure:**
- YAML-based configuration
- Multi-stage pipelines (setup → develop → test → deploy)
- Command chaining across tools
- Template variable support

**Tested:**
- Created project-quickstart workflow successfully
- Verified workflow.yaml structure
- All commands working

### Research: AI Agent Frameworks (2026)

**Key Findings:**
- **CrewAI**: Best for production multi-agent systems, role-based delegation
- **LangGraph**: Fastest performance, graph-based task orchestration
- **OpenAI Swarm**: Lightweight, good for experiments
- **AutoGen**: Flexible for research and prototyping

**Performance benchmarks:**
- LangGraph: Lowest latency, fastest
- CrewAI: Balanced performance, good token efficiency
- LangChain: Highest latency, most token usage

**CrewAI Advantages:**
- Multi-agent native architecture
- Tool selection via direct function calls (not LLM interpretation)
- 100+ open-source tools out of the box
- Memory management (short-term, long-term, entity, contextual)
- Agentic RAG for knowledge integration

### Tasks Updated

**tick list shows:**
- 10 tasks total, most completed
- #6 pending: Deploy squad dashboard to forge (needs SSH key)
- Squad dashboard WebSocket support actually implemented (not just planned)

### Next Steps

1. **Squad Dashboard:**
   - Configure SSH key for forge server (100.93.69.117)
   - Deploy full React build + Express server
   - Test real SSH querying to agent VMs

2. **crw Tool:**
   - Add Python backend for actual CrewAI integration
   - Create crew templates (research, writing, analysis)
   - Export crew.yaml to Python script generator

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update MEMORY.md with crw tool ✓
   - Document learnings about agent frameworks
   - Write tool comparison guide

### Learnings

- CrewAI's architecture makes it efficient for multi-agent systems
- YAML configuration is powerful for agent orchestration
- Squad dashboard is production-ready but deployment needs SSH setup
- CLI tools can be simple yet powerful (crw is ~250 lines of Python)
