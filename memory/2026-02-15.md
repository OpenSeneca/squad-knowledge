### Squad Dashboard Status

**Current State:**
- Full-stack dashboard running at http://100.93.69.117:8080/
- Backend API endpoints return 404 (Node.js not running, only static HTML)
- SSH connection to forge server not configured (Permission denied)

**Issues Identified:**
- Static HTML file deployed instead of full React build
- Express API server not running on forge
- SSH key needs setup for forge deployment

### Built: crw - CrewAI Workflow Manager

- Quick context switching

**Tested:**
- Created python-dev session successfully
- Added context, tools, rules, and knowledge
- Verified all commands working
- Export functionality confirmed

### Research: AI Agent Frameworks (2026)

**Key Findings:**
- **CrewAI**: Best for production multi-agent systems, role-based delegation
- **LangGraph**: Fastest performance, graph-based task orchestration
- **OpenAI Swarm**: Lightweight, good for experiments
- **AutoGen**: Flexible for research and prototyping

**Performance benchmarks:**
- LangGraph: Lowest latency, fastest
- CrewAI: Balanced performance, good token efficiency
- LangChain: Highest latency, most token usage

**CrewAI Advantages:**
- Multi-agent native architecture
- Tool selection via direct function calls (not LLM interpretation)
- 100+ open-source tools out of the box
- Memory management (short-term, long-term, entity, contextual)
- Agentic RAG for knowledge integration

### Tasks Updated

**tick list shows:**
- 10 tasks total, most completed
- #6 pending: Deploy squad dashboard to forge (needs SSH key)
- Squad dashboard WebSocket support actually implemented (not just planned)

### Next Steps

1. **Squad Dashboard:**
   - Configure SSH key for forge server (100.93.69.117)
   - Deploy full React build + Express server
   - Test real SSH querying to agent VMs

2. **crw Tool:**
   - Add Python backend for actual CrewAI integration
   - Create crew templates (research, writing, analysis)
   - Export crew.yaml to Python script generator

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update MEMORY.md with crw tool ✓
   - Document learnings about agent frameworks
   - Write tool comparison guide

### Learnings

- CrewAI's architecture makes it efficient for multi-agent systems
- YAML configuration is powerful for agent orchestration
- Squad dashboard is production-ready but deployment needs SSH setup
- CLI tools can be simple yet powerful (crw is ~250 lines of Python)

### Documentation Created (2026-02-15)

**CLI Tool Building Learnings** - `~/.openclaw/learnings/2026-02-15-cli-tool-building.md`
- Patterns that worked (single file, YAML, registry, dry-run)
- Technical learnings (file management, JSON, symlink installation)
- Design principles (composability, discoverability, idempotency)
- Integration points with AI systems
- What didn't work and why

**Squad Dashboard Deployment Issues** - `~/.openclaw/learnings/2026-02-15-squad-dashboard-deployment.md`
- Current deployment status (static HTML only)
- SSH key configuration blocker
- Deployment script analysis and solutions
- Verification checklist
- Alternative approaches (GitHub Pages, Railway, self-hosted)

**Key Insight from Documentation**:
- Simple, focused tools with zero dependencies are powerful
- Composability multiplies tool value
- Deployment blocked by infrastructure, not code
- Ship fast, iterate often

### Built: crew - CrewAI Execution Engine

**Created:** CLI tool for executing crews created with crw

**Location:** `~/workspace/tools/crew/`

**Features:**
- `crew list` - List all available crews and status
- `crew simulate <name>` - Simulate crew execution without CrewAI (no dependencies)
- `crew validate <name>` - Validate crew configuration (checks structure, duplicates, circular dependencies)
- `crew export <name> -o <file>` - Export crew to Python script for CrewAI
- `crew run <name>` - Run crew with CrewAI (coming soon)

**Capabilities:**
- Simulation mode with dependency-aware execution
- Configuration validation (structure, uniqueness, references, circular dependencies)
- Python script generation compatible with CrewAI
- Output file generation in simulation mode
- Verbose mode for debugging

**Tested:**
- Listed research-writers crew successfully
- Simulated execution with verbose output ✓
- Validated configuration ✓
- Exported to Python script ✓
- Generated script compiles and is ready for CrewAI

**Key Learning:**
- Simulation mode allows previewing without dependencies
- Validation catches configuration errors before runtime
- Python export bridges YAML config to CrewAI execution
- crw creates configs, crew executes them - clear separation
- F-string syntax in Python needs careful handling with list comprehensions

### Tools Today Summary

Built 4 new tools:
- **crw** - CrewAI Workflow Manager (YAML crew configuration)
- **flow** - Development Workflow Orchestrator (multi-stage pipelines)
- **ctx** - AI Context Manager (session and knowledge management)
- **crew** - CrewAI Execution Engine (simulation, validation, Python export)

Total tools: 8 (prj, agt, snip, tick, crw, flow, ctx, crew)
