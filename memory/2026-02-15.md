### Research: AI Agent Frameworks (2026)

**Key Findings:**
- **CrewAI**: Best for production multi-agent systems, role-based delegation
- **LangGraph**: Fastest performance, graph-based task orchestration
- **OpenAI Swarm**: Lightweight, good for experiments
- **AutoGen**: Flexible for research and prototyping

**Performance benchmarks:**
- LangGraph: Lowest latency, fastest
- CrewAI: Balanced performance, good token efficiency
- LangChain: Highest latency, most token usage

**CrewAI Advantages:**
- Multi-agent native architecture
- Tool selection via direct function calls (not LLM interpretation)
- 100+ open-source tools out of the box
- Memory management (short-term, long-term, entity, contextual)
- Agentic RAG for knowledge integration

### Tasks Updated

**tick list shows:**
- 10 tasks total, most completed
- #6 pending: Deploy squad dashboard to forge (needs SSH key)
- Squad dashboard WebSocket support actually implemented (not just planned)

### Next Steps

1. **Squad Dashboard:**
   - Configure SSH key for forge server (100.93.69.117)
   - Deploy full React build + Express server
   - Test real SSH querying to agent VMs

2. **crw Tool:**
   - Add Python backend for actual CrewAI integration
   - Create crew templates (research, writing, analysis)
   - Export crew.yaml to Python script generator

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update MEMORY.md with crw tool ✓
   - Document learnings about agent frameworks
   - Write tool comparison guide

### Learnings

- CrewAI's architecture makes it efficient for multi-agent systems
- YAML configuration is powerful for agent orchestration
- Squad dashboard is production-ready but deployment needs SSH setup
- CLI tools can be simple yet powerful (crw is ~250 lines of Python)

### Documentation Created (2026-02-15)

**CLI Tool Building Learnings** - `~/.openclaw/learnings/2026-02-15-cli-tool-building.md`
- Patterns that worked (single file, YAML, registry, dry-run)
- Technical learnings (file management, JSON, symlink installation)
- Design principles (composability, discoverability, idempotency)
- Integration points with AI systems
- What didn't work and why

**Squad Dashboard Deployment Issues** - `~/.openclaw/learnings/2026-02-15-squad-dashboard-deployment.md`
- Current deployment status (static HTML only)
- SSH key configuration blocker
- Deployment script analysis and solutions
- Verification checklist
- Alternative approaches (GitHub Pages, Railway, self-hosted)

**Key Insight from Documentation**:
- Simple, focused tools with zero dependencies are powerful
- Composability multiplies tool value
- Deployment blocked by infrastructure, not code
- Ship fast, iterate often

### Built: crew - CrewAI Execution Engine

**Created:** CLI tool for executing crews created with crw

**Location:** `~/workspace/tools/crew/`

**Features:**
- `crew list` - List all available crews and status
- `crew simulate <name>` - Simulate crew execution without CrewAI (no dependencies)
- `crew validate <name>` - Validate crew configuration (checks structure, duplicates, circular dependencies)
- `crew export <name> -o <file>` - Export crew to Python script for CrewAI
- `crew run <name>` - Run crew with CrewAI (coming soon)

**Capabilities:**
- Simulation mode with dependency-aware execution
- Configuration validation (structure, uniqueness, references, circular dependencies)
- Python script generation compatible with CrewAI
- Output file generation in simulation mode
- Verbose mode for debugging

**Tested:**
- Listed research-writers crew successfully
- Simulated execution with verbose output ✓
- Validated configuration ✓
- Exported to Python script ✓
- Generated script compiles and is ready for CrewAI

**Key Learning:**
- Simulation mode allows previewing without dependencies
- Validation catches configuration errors before runtime
- Python export bridges YAML config to CrewAI execution
- crw creates configs, crew executes them - clear separation
- F-string syntax in Python needs careful handling with list comprehensions
- Centralized tool management improves discoverability

### Tools Today Summary

### Squad Dashboard: SSH Querying Implementation

**Implemented SSH querying in AgentService.ts:**
- Replaced placeholder `queryViaSSH()` with actual implementation
- Uses Node.js `child_process.exec()` to SSH to agent VMs
- Runs `openclaw status` command on agent machines
- Parses OpenClaw status output to extract agent state
- Falls back to "offline" status on SSH failures
- 10-second timeout for SSH queries
- Handles multiple agent VMs (marcus-squad, archimedes-squad, argus-squad, galen-squad)

**Created SSH Setup Documentation:**
- `SSH_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive guide for configuring SSH access
- Covers SSH key exchange, manual key copy, and OpenClaw status verification
- Troubleshooting section for common SSH issues (timeouts, permission denied, command not found)
- Alternative query methods (HTTP API, OpenClaw nodes integration)
- Security considerations and firewall configuration
- Deployment checklist for production

**Created Quick Reference:**
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Command cheat sheet for squad dashboard
- Common commands for local development and production
- PM2 monitoring commands
- Configuration examples
- Troubleshooting quick fixes
- File location reference

**Current State:**
- ✅ SSH querying code implemented in AgentService.ts
- ✅ Code tested - server starts correctly, attempts SSH queries
- ✅ Fallback to simulation data works when SSH fails
- ✅ Error messages are clear and helpful
- ✅ Documentation created for SSH setup
- ⏳ SSH keys not configured (Permission denied on all agent VMs)
- ⏳ marcus-squad has DNS resolution issue
- ⏳ Ready to deploy once SSH access is configured

**Testing Results:**
- Server starts successfully on port 3000
- SSH queries attempted to all 4 agent VMs
- All queries fall back to simulation data as expected
- Error messages clearly indicate the issue (DNS/permissions)
- Dashboard continues serving despite query failures
- WebSocket broadcast system working correctly

### Built: squad-setup - AI Squad Dashboard SSH Setup Helper

**Created:** Automation tool for setting up SSH access to squad dashboard agent VMs

**Location:** `~/workspace/tools/squad-setup/`

**Install:** Already symlinked to `~/.local/bin/squad-setup`

**Commands:**
- `squad-setup test` - Test SSH connectivity to all VMs
- `squad-setup copy-keys` - Copy SSH keys to VMs automatically
- `squad-setup verify` - Verify OpenClaw status on each VM
- `squad-setup status` - Show current setup status summary
- `squad-setup auto` - Run full setup pipeline

**Features:**
- Detects SSH key status
- Tests connectivity to all 4 agent VMs
- Copies public key to authorized_keys on each VM
- Verifies OpenClaw installation and status
- Color-coded output (green for success, yellow for warnings, red for errors)
- Progress indicators and next steps
- Handles DNS resolution failures, permission denied, timeouts

**Agent VMs:**
- marcus-squad (Research Agent)
- archimedes-squad (Build Agent)
- argus-squad (Infrastructure Agent)
- galen-squad (Deep Research Agent)

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Tool created, tested, and working
- ✅ Detects current SSH setup state correctly
- ✅ Shows clear next steps for manual setup
- ⏳ DNS issue with marcus-squad needs fixing
- ⏳ SSH keys need to be copied to agent VMs

**Tested:**
- `squad-setup status` - Shows 0/4 connected, 3/4 permission denied, 1/4 DNS error
- `squad-setup verify` - Correctly fails with SSH access denied
- All commands working as designed

**Purpose:**
This tool unblocks the squad dashboard deployment by automating the SSH setup process. It tests connectivity, copies keys, and verifies OpenClaw status - all manual steps that were blocking deployment.

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix DNS for marcus-squad (add to /etc/hosts or use IP)
2. Copy SSH keys to all agent VMs (`squad-setup copy-keys` or manual)
3. Run `squad-setup verify` to confirm OpenClaw is running
4. Deploy squad dashboard: `cd ~/workspace/squad-dashboard && ./deploy-forge.sh`

**Next Steps for Deployment:**
1. Set up SSH keys for agent VMs (see SSH_SETUP.md)
2. Verify `openclaw status` works on each agent
3. Test SSH queries locally: `npm run server:dev`
4. Deploy to forge server: `./deploy-forge.sh`
5. Verify dashboard at http://100.93.69.117:8080/

**Files Updated:**
- `server/services/AgentService.ts` - Implemented `queryViaSSH()` and `parseOpenClawStatus()`

**Files Created:**
- `SSH_SETUP.md` - 7,389 bytes
- `QUICKSTART.md` - 2,991 bytes
