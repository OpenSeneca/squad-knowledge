## Key Learnings

- **GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw)** - Technical preview, Continuous AI
  - Automate repository tasks with coding agents in GitHub Actions
  - Author workflows in Markdown, compiled to YAML
  - Guardrails: read-only by default, safe-outputs for operations

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - Future of AI assistant integration
  - Open-source standard for connecting AI to external tools
  - SDKs: Python (FastMCP), TypeScript, C#, Java
  - MCP servers expose: tools (functions), resources (data), prompts (templates)
  - No API keys needed, runs locally
  - Google Gemini CLI, Goose, Crush, Cline all support MCP - validates squad approach

- **2026 AI Tool Landscape** - Rapid diversification and innovation
  - Big-Lab Native: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI
  - Independent: Aider (39K+ stars), OpenCode (95K+), Goose (Apache 2.0), Crush, Kilo
  - Key trends: Multi-model support (75+ providers), MCP standardization, specialized agents, autonomy spectrum
  - Model flexibility and extensibility are critical differentiators
  - Terminal is re-emerging as center of AI-assisted development

- **Coding CLI Tools Patterns** (Feb 2026)
  - 15+ serious tools now available (up from "Copilot vs Cursor" a year ago)
  - Accessibility (WCAG compliance) important for enterprise tools
  - Tailscale Governance for secure AI networking
  - Browser automation capabilities in modern agents (testing, form filling, web interaction)
  - Context understanding (not code generation) is the real competition

- **Squad Knowledge Management** - Critical for team alignment
  - squad-knowledge tool (502 lines) maintains architectural decisions and conventions
  - 22 entries covering: Architecture, Convention, Integration, Deployment, Security
  - Use cases: Onboarding, decision lookup, maintaining consistency
  - Pattern: Knowledge base for "why did we do X?" questions
