## Tools Verified as NOT Busywork

Per seed-engineering-standards.md, these tools PASS the test:

**The Test:**
1. Does this tool have a specific user? (Justin, Seneca, or a squad agent) ✅
2. Would that user run it more than once? ✅
3. Does something equivalent already exist? ❌

**Priority Tools:**
- twitter-post → Seneca runs daily
- squad-dashboard → Justin checks daily
- squad-output-digest → Justin checks daily
- paper-summarizer → Marcus/Galen run regularly
- blog-assistant → Justin runs weekly
- research-extractor → Seneca runs daily

All priority tools are **useful, not busywork**.
